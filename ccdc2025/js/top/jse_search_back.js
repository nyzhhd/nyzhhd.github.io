s[i++]="Welcome Message^wel.html^ ^  The IEEE sponsored 6th International Conference CCDC 2016- themed on Cloud Computing and Big Data is organized by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Amity School of Engineering and Technology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh in collaboration with EMC Corporation from 14th -15th January, 2016. All accepted & presented papers of the Conference by duly registered authors, will be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library for Publication.  The era of productivity has seen the emergence of Cloud Computing. Big companies, numerous research groups from academia, national governments and international institutions, not only speak but deploy and use cloud services all around the world. Cloud benefits have many unique attributes that raise security challenges in areas of data security, recovery, access control, privacy and trusted computing. While the benefits of cloud computing are compelling, “Big Data” has become a ubiquitous term. It is an emerging paradigm applied to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. It is hard to collect, analyze, visualize and process for businesses of various sizes. The theme of the conference is the need of the hour as both the emerging technologies, Big Data and Cloud Security continue to converge and mutually promote each other.  CCDC 2016 is an opportunity for academic research communities, experts from industries, scientists and participants to exchange novel ideas and share new research and developments in the field of Cloud Security and Big Data in today’s ubiquitous virtual environment. The main objective of organizing the summit is to exchange ideas and bridge the gap between industry and academia and to peek into the future prospects of Cloud Security and Big Data. The range of papers presented will ensure an interesting and enlightened discussion spread over two days.  We were fortunate to attract high interest among the community. The IEEE sponsored 6th International Conference; CCDC received a huge participation of 491 manuscripts from around the world. Out of these only 186 manuscripts are selected after a regressive selection process that has an acceptance ratio of 33 and 143 papers were registered for the presentation during CCDC 2016. Papers accepted and presented during the Conference will be uploaded on IEEE Xplore database and listed on Scopus which is the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature. These together with the poster presentations speak volumes about the popularity and quality of the CCDC for exchanging ideas and finding solutions to Cloud Security and Big Data.  The conference provides a leading forum for disseminating the latest advancements in research and development, themed mainly on “Cloud Security and Big Data” with various sub-themes much awaited and needed in today’s professional scenario.

These movements plays very important role in conveying the emotional states of individual to the observer. Human face-to-face communication is important in human interaction. In recent years, different approaches have been put forward for developing methods for fully automated facial expressions analysis that is important for human computer interaction. In Facial Expression Recognition System the image is processed to extract such information from it, which can help in recognizing six universal expressions that are neutral, happy, sad, angry, disgust and surprise. This processing is done in several phases including image acquisition, features extraction and finally expressions classification. This paper surveys some of the techniques that are used for the purpose of facial expression recognition; a summary of some of the papers from 2001 to 2012 is given at the end in tabular form. A list of few challenges in this field is given at the end along with the possible future advancements. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Facial expression recognition, Image acquisition, Features extraction, Classification.

Data scientists had studied market behavior by applying behavior study tools like Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) and OpinionFinder on information available through news and social media platforms like twitter. But behavior finance is still at a novice state and growing with a substantial pace. Data required for the market is big, heterogeneous and mammoth. It consists of prices of stock exchanges as well as socio &#8211; political &#8211; economic data from all over the globe. Green database design will help to increase the efficiency of the database towards green drive but restricted to the prices of the stock. In continuation of our previous work on green computing in financial market, we are proposing a model as score based financial forecasting method by incorporating different sources of integrated information flow into integrative river model. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Green database, Stock market, News, Social media, Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) and OpinionFinder.

s[i++]="Energy Optimized VM Placement in Cloud Environment^018.xml^Amandeep Kaur and Mala Kalra^Energy Optimized VM Placement in Cloud Environment Large energy hungry datacenters are increasing at an alarming rate, making energy management as one of the key design constraints for the cloud datacenters. Energy consumption in cloud datacenters can be reduced by employing VM consolidation technique which is the process of packing VMs on the least number of servers and VM consolidation uses VM migration technique for this purpose. But unnecessary migrations may lead to performance degradation, service level agreement violations, service down time. Efficiency of system that employs virtualization greatly depends on the technology used to allocate VMs to the appropriate hosts. This gives significant importance to VM Placement Problem (VMPP). The aim of VM placement problem is to put the idle server to low-power consuming mode and to reduce the number of overall migrations in a system. In this paper, an algorithm based on MBFD has been proposed for VM placement. The goal is to reduce the number of active servers and to obtain a stable host for each VM such that the number of unnecessary migrations and total power consumption can be reduced. The performance of proposed algorithm is compared to that of an existing MBFD placement algorithm. The result shows that the proposed algorithm saves more energy than the method compared to. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Cloud computing, Power management, Virtualization, VM consolidation, Virtual machine placement problem.

s[i++]="Big Data representation for Grade Analysis Through Hadoop Framework^032.xml^Chitresh Verma and Rajiv Pandey^Big Data representation for Grade Analysis Through Hadoop Framework Big Data is a large dataset displaying the features of volume, velocity and variety in an OR relationship. Big Data as a large dataset is of no significance if it cannot be exposed to strategic analysis and utilization. There are many software and hardware solutions available in the technological landscape that enable capturing, storing and subsequently analysis of Big Data.

s[i++]="A Trust Based Secure Routing Scheme for MANETS^056.xml^V. Sesha Bhargavi,  M. Seetha and S. Viswanadharaju^A Trust Based Secure Routing Scheme for MANETS A MANET is a kind of wireless mobile network that can be easily established with the help of few infrastructure less connections. In such networks, every node is independent of its own and hence can act as a router and performs the job of routing as well. All the nodes in a MANET are dynamic in nature, in that the nodes can change their location from time to time due to their mobility feature, and any node is free to join and leave the network as and when needed and hence we can say that the topology changes dynamically. In recent days, security in MANET&#8217;s has been the prime focus within the research community. There are many different attacks aimed at MANET&#8217;s but solutions to these have been not paid much attention in literature. There are several methods that can deal with security issues in wired networks but the same cannot be used for wireless networks. There are many routing protocols proposed for MANET&#8217;s but most of them exhibit poor performance in the presence of malicious nodes. This paper focuses on a new hybrid secure routing protocol S-DSR that establishes a secure communication path across the nodes in the network which can improve the packet delivery ratio and throughput etc. This protocol helps in finding the best path for secure file transmission based on the trust information from the neighbouring nodes. The proposed protocol has been implemented on NS-2.

s[i++]="Wormhole Attacks in Manet^060.xml^Nitika Gupta and Shailendra Narayan Singh^Wormhole Attacks in Manet A mobile ad hoc network or MANET are those wireless networks which posses no infrastructure which are connected by the wireless nodes. And these nodes are generally mobile and the connectionless links are used basically to connect these nodes and these nodes have the capability to self organize and self configure and self arrangement capability. They are not having uniform structure. Because of their mobility and their dynamic nature they are prone to many kinds of malicious attacks by the malicious users because in this every node acts as a sender receiver and the router so no node can be able to understand whether the data has been sent by the malicious sender or the true sender or the receiving node is the true node. Hence by this the data can be lost as well as can be dropped by the malicious user and it can send the fake data to the receiver as well. So there are actually many kinds of attacks at the network layer. MANETS are generally more prone to cyber attacks rather than the wired networks because of their mobile nature. So these attacks like wormhole attacks are a very big issue in the case of networks. As the demand of wireless networks is increasing day by day. So it is a big concern of about how to prevent these kinds of attacks. So that they may not affect the network layer further. So in this paper we are focusing upon these attacks and also about how by using hardware rather than software we can solve the wormhole attacks by using cryptography and the digital signature method. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Digital signature, Warmhole attack, Cryptography, MANETS, Cyber attack.

The objective is to flow and maintain traffic system automatically but unfortunately jamming queue exists while everything is fine from technology point of view because of predefined static time duration. This predefined time slots fail to capture real time scenarios in terms of traffic load and that leads to congestion. To avoid such type of problem, this work contributes the concept of dynamic traffic light slots as a best possible solution. Dynamic traffic light is a concept of controlling the time duration of RED and GREEN light according to traffic flow or by sensing flow of traffic on road in movement. This can be achieved by using Global Positioning System which will convey the details of traffic flow and by considering that, time slots are provided to traffic lights i.e. whole controlling and managing will work like Real Time System. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Traffic congestion, Dynamic traffic light, GPS, RTS.

Major requirements for the development of qubits like critically low temperatures (for superconductivity) are not only difficult to achieve but can be economically unfriendly.

In this paper, the extended version of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is suggested which can prevent the system against Mim attack and plain-text attack. This algorithm is oriented towards removing the extended version of Diffie-Hellman algorithm. It uses one model based on arbitrary numbers and logarithms. This is considered to provide security improvement to the communication channel and also countermeasure the attack. Also, a cloud based model is presented for engineering educational domain.

Nowadays, cameras are easily available in the smart phones that can be carried in the small space of our pockets while being lightweight, portable and relieving us from the burden of walking down to a scanner for a digital copy of a document. But even though capturing a document image through a phone camera appears simple, the chances of obtaining a perfect picture are scanty. As when the picture is captured in an unconstrained environment, there are chances of degradation to creep in that will hamper the visual quality of the document image which further effect the readability(in terms of OCR accuracy). Low quality documents give poor results. Document images contain various degradations such as blur, uneven illumination, perspective distortion, low resolution, smear etc. Quality enhancement is helpful to recognize a camera captured document more accurately and if not completely removing the degradations, it can be used for suppressing them and making the text more readable. This paper evaluates the performance of various de-blurring techniques for noisy and blurred camera captured documents. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Camera captured documents, Document image processing, OCR accuracy, Quality enhancement.

It focuses on embedding watermark information into a digital host object in an inseparable bond to authenticate the latter. This paper proposes a high-capacity blind audio watermarking technique within perceptual constraints, i.e., the manipulations performed during the embedding process are imperceptible to unaided human senses. The suggested scheme uses high-frequency wavelet coefficients obtained during the quantization in Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain since redundant information can be accommodated with more ease in the high-frequency sub-band. Arnold Transformation is used for watermark permutation to ensure increased security and robustness of the scheme. From the experimental results, it follows that the illustrated scheme offers a healthy trade-off between payload, imperceptibility and robustness. The algorithm offers a fairly high Payload of 2755.6 bits per second while constantly maintaining the SNR, NCC and BER values well within the specified standards &#8211; even when been subjected to signal processing attacks. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Blind audio watermarking, Digital signal processing, Discrete wavelet transform, Multimedia security.

Errors that are encountered during the first phase of the cycle migrate to other phases too which in turn results in the most costly process than the original specified process. The reason is that the specifications of software requirements are termed in the Nature Language Format. One can easily transform the requirements specified into computer model using UML. To minimize the errors that arise in the existing system, we have proposed a new technique that enhances the generation of UML models through Natural Language requirements, which can easily provide automatic assistance to the developers. The main aim of our paper is to focus on the production of Activity Diagram and Sequence Diagram through Natural Language Specifications. Standard POS tagger and parser analyze the input i.e., requirements in English language given by the users and extract phrases, activities, etc. from the text specifies. The technique is beneficial as it reduces the gap between informal natural language and the formal modeling language. The input is the requirements laid down by the users in English language.

While moving on road it is possible that some intruder can enter into network and hinder the normal operation of the VANET network. One of the prominent services is to assure security of vehicles from attacks incurred due to these intruders. Therefore, an authentication mechanism is required that will restrict the entry of malicious nodes in the network. Number of authentication protocols is being used in VANET such as Digital Certificate Authentication (DCA), Pairing, and Intermediary Re-encryption (IRE), and many more. From the existing ones, IRE works well in terms of preventing attacks from unauthorized users in the network. Still IRE is susceptible to attacks like eavesdropping, denial of service attack, masquerading. To overcome the above stated attacks an Enhanced Intermediary Re-encryption (EIRE) method for authentication is proposed in this paper.

Aggressive nanoscaling of MOS transistor in process technology has advanced in chip density, but to achieve high performance and lower power consumption by continues scaling results in shorter channel effect and Lowering of Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). To overcome from this situation double gate device like FinFET is used which has excellent control over the thin silicon fins with two electrically coupled gate, which mitigate shorter channel effect and exponentially reduces the leakage current. In this research paper we have utilize the property of FinFET technology in SRAM circuit design to lower power consumption. Proposed circuit shows maximum saving of dynamic power up to 76.57% in 4T, maximum leakage power saving upto 53.21% in 6T at 25&#176;C and 45.13% at 110&#176;C.

s[i++]="Graph-Based Concept Discovery In Multi Relational Data^438.xml^Yusuf Kavurucu, Alev Mutlu and Tolga Ensari^Graph-Based Concept Discovery in Multi Relational Data Developments in technology, especially in computer science created the need of storing data in variety of areas. This need created the term database where the data is stored in a useful form. In the database, data is logically integrated in file/files according to relations among them. One of the important issues is to extract knowledge from these databases that hold data in a useful and complete form. This process is called as data mining. The main objective of data mining is to extract implicit and useful knowledge from huge and at first glance meaningless mass of data that is stored in database(s). Multi-Relational databases are the ones in which the data is stored in multiple tables (relations). The relationships between those tables are also stored as tables (relations) in the database. The more effective and commonly known approaches for Multi-Relational Data Mining (MRDM) are based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). ILP contains concepts from Inductive Learning and Logic Programming. From this point, the main purpose of MRDM is extracting implicit and trivial knowledge from relational database(s) using ILP approaches and techniques. In this approach, data is represented in graph structures and graph mining techniques are used for knowledge discovery. Concept discovery in multi-relational data mining aims to find relational rules that best describe a relation, called target relation, in terms of other relations in the database, called background knowledge. In this study, a graph-based concept discovery method for concept discovery is presented. The proposed method, namely GCDS (Graph-based Concept Discovery System), utilizes methods both from substructure-based and path-finding based approaches, hence it can be considered as a hybrid method. GCDS generates disconnected graph structures for each target relation and its related background knowledge, which are initially stored in a relational database, and utilizes them to guide generation of a summary graph. The summary graph is traversed to find concept descriptors. A set of experiments is conducted on datasets that belong to different learning problems. The experimental results show that G-CDS is capable of learning definitions of target relations that belong to different learning problems. <italic>Keywords: </italic>Multi relational data mining, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), Concept discovery, Graph.

Digital Watermarking makes an attempt to resolve the problems associated with the management of property of media. It ends up in unauthorized copying and redistribution of digital content. In the proposed method, cover image is decomposed into low and high frequency components by the application of 3-level Discrete Wavelet Transform. Average of each subband is calculated. The watermark is embedded into the Discrete Wavelet Transform decomposed subbands of cover image using Arithmetic Progression technique. The subband which has the smallest average is to be embedded first. After that, the watermarked image is projected to several attacks like median filtering, JPEG compression, Gaussian low-pass filtering, shearing cropping, rotation etc. with different distortion strengths. The watermark which is embedded in the middle frequency subbands and high frequency subband is taken out by similar mechanism.
