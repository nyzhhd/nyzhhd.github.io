s[i++]="Keynote Address^key1.html^Keynote Address 1^ From Refined Anti-Disturbance Control Theory to Bionic Intelligent System TechnologyBy Prof. Lei GuoAcademician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beihang University, ChinaVenue Grand Ballroom on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 09:00 – 10:00 hrs AbstractOne of the technical bottleneck faced by unmanned systems lies in overcoming the limitations of preset missions, ideal environments, and deterministic models, and achieving precise, reliable, and autonomous control in extreme (dangerous, harsh and hostile) environments. Over billions of years of evolution, animals have developed strong and intelligent survival abilities, enabling them to adapt and thrive even in the most extreme and harsh environments. Similarly, in environments with disturbances and oppositions, the intelligence of unmanned systems is not limited to the common brain-like intelligence, but has the ability of smart mind, clear vision, skillful hands and healthy body so as to survive under complicated conditions of multiple constraints, high dynamics, and strong adversarial challenges. In this talk, we will begin with the refined anti-disturbance estimation and control theory for multiple disturbance systems and introduce the theoretical and technological research framework for bionic intelligent systems under complicated disturbance and adversarial environments. In particular, some of our recent research progress will be outlined in biomimetic navigation, biomimetic control, and intelligent control systems. Finally, the fundamental connotations and future development directions of biomimetic intelligence technologies will be explored from the viewpoints of methodology (safety), system theory (green) and behavior theory (immunity).BiographyProf. Lei Guo was born in Qufu, China, in 1966. He received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree from Qufu Normal University, in 1988 and 1991, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1997.

s[i++]="Keynote Address^key2.html^Keynote Address 2^ Dynamic Coverage Control and Network Clustering By Prof. Carolyn BeckUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USAVenue Grand Ballroom on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 10:00 – 11:00 hrs AbstractIn this talk we present a framework for solving a large class of dynamic coverage control and network clustering problems, ranging from those that arise in determining dynamic placement of edge controller nodes in software defined networks, to the deployment of mobile sensor networks, to identification of ensemble spike trains in neuronal data, to the design of distributed water networks, to the reduction of graphs and Markov chains. This framework provides the ability to identify natural clusters in an underlying dynamic data set and connectivity structures in large graphs, and allows us to address inherent trade-offs such as those that frequently arise in constrained resource allocation problems. We define the problem of minimizing an instantaneous coverage metric as an optimization problem using a maximum entropy formulation constructed specifically for a dynamic setting, where locating cluster centers and tracking their associated dynamics is cast as a control design problem. We will provide an overview of our dynamic coverage algorithm along with some analysis of the algorithm properties and conclude with a few highlighted applications as time allows.BiographyProf. Carolyn Beck was born in Pasadena, California. She received her PhD from California Institute of Technology (Caltech), her MS from Carnegie Mellon, and her BS from California State Polytechnic University, all in Electrical Engineering.

s[i++]="Keynote Address^key3.html^Keynote Address 3^ Development and Prospects of Control Technologies for Large-Scale Renewable Energy SystemsBy Prof. Chenghui ZhangShandong University, ChinaVenue Grand Ballroom on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 11:00 – 12:00 hrs AbstractEnergy is the cornerstone of industry and the lifeblood of the national economy, providing the material foundation and power source that drive the progress of human civilization. However, as traditional energy sources are gradually depleted, the large-scale development and utilization of renewable energy has become a global consensus and a national strategy in China. And information control technology directly determines the success of energy transformation. Nevertheless, renewable energy systems are essentially massive and complex systems, characterized by high dynamics, nonlinearity, and strong coupling. The modeling, control, and optimization of these systems are recognized as global challenges by the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). Especially, China’s requirements for new energy grid integration are more stringent than those in Europe and the United States, posing severe challenges to control theory and application technologies.To this end, we systematically summarize the global development of control theories in new energy systems, particularly highlighting the landmark achievements in control theory and technology that have emerged during the large-scale development of new energy in China. These include variable gain robust control, distributed collaborative control, and intelligent partition based global optimization methods, which have tackled key challenges such as nonlinear strong tracking control, massive-state consistency control, and non-convex dynamic optimization in new energy systems. The innovative achievements have been applied to three core aspects of new energy system, i.e. grid integration control (inject power to grid), power quality control (enhance power quality), and battery energy storage control (peak shaving and valley filling), achieving stable grid integration of new energy, high-capacity equipment manufacturing, and optimal management of power stations. These achievements have bridged the gap between information control theory and new energy power generation technology, providing crucial theoretical insights and engineering demonstrations for the large-scale application of new energy. Finally, the report looks ahead to the promising prospect of deep integration between the metaverse and new energy systems, offering a new paradigm for the digital and intelligent control of new energy.BiographyProf. Chenghui Zhang is currently a Chair Professor and Dean of the School of Control Science and Engineering at Shandong University. He is the founder and Director of National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Renewable Energy and Efficient Energy Conversion Technology. He is a IEEE Fellow, CAA Fellow and CPSS Fellow.

s[i++]="Distinguished Lectures^dislec4.html^Distinguished Lecture 1^Control Perspectives on Climate Change: Understanding Feedback Loops in Societal-Scale Systems By Associate Prof. Guodong Shi University of Sydney, Australia Venue Multi-function Room on the 2nd Floor Date/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 14:30 – 15:30 hrs Abstract The interactions between infrastructure, climate, geophysical, and socio-economic systems create complex feedback loops. These loops drive some of the most pressing challenges we face today: the existential threats of climate change have largely arisen from humanitys neglect of its impact on the global environment. Today, understanding the interplay of these feedback loops is crucial for developing reliable climate-change predictions and designing socially viable mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this talk, we explore the challenges and opportunities of studying such societal-scale systems from a control systems perspective, where known and unknown dynamics coexist, uncertainties are unevenly distributed, and data mismatches arise across spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate how theories from social opinion dynamics and dynamic games provide insights into the global climate future, particularly in a world where regions simultaneously engage in both cooperation and competition in climate policy.Biography Associate Prof. Guodong Shi received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the School of Mathematics, Shandong University, Jinan, China in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in systems theory from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China in 2010.

s[i++]="Distinguished Lectures^dislec2.html^Distinguished Lecture 2^ Fault-Tolerant Trajectory Tracking Control for Networked Flexible Robotic Arms under DoS Attacks By Prof. Yu Liu South China University of Technology, China Venue Multi-function Room on the 2nd Floor Date/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 15:40 – 16:40 hrs  AbstractIn the field of industrial automation and intelligent manufacturing, networked mobile parallel flexible robotic arms are widely used in complex environments and diverse collaborative tasks due to their high precision and strong adaptability. However, distributed DoS attacks pose a serious threat to the stability and control performance of robotic arm networks. Moreover, actuator fault compensation and control with predefined performance constraints are crucial for enhancing the security of the network. To address these challenges, this report primarily focuses on the issue of time-varying trajectory tracking control with predefined performance constraints for networked mobile parallel flexible robotic arms under DoS attacks and actuator faults. Firstly, a multi-agent network composed of heterogeneous external linear systems and mobile parallel flexible robotic arms is constructed. Secondly, an adaptive distributed switching observer is proposed, under which the observation error can asymptotically converge under the resilient control strategy. Thirdly, by integrating methods and techniques such as adaptive fault-tolerant control, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, boundary control, and output-constrained control, a boundary adaptive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control algorithm with predefined performance constraints is proposed to achieve time-varying consensus tracking among multiple robotic arms. Finally, numerical simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. This work can further advance the research on coordinated control of multiple flexible robots and provide a theoretical basis and technical support for collaborative operations of multi-robot systems in complex environments.BiographyProf. Yu Liu is currently a professor with the South China University of Technology.

Some of the prime components of an ICAS -- having a measurable impact on its operational efficiency and productivity -- are its sensors and actuators. These are the devices that allow the ICAS to collect data from its environment, as well as to use these data to steer itself toward a desirable direction. To account for the cognitive limitations of ICAS, we introduce ideas and principles of bounded rationality for autonomy using tools from control theory and reinforcement learning. Specifically, we will formulate level-k thinking and cognitive hierarchy models in nonlinear and linear noncooperative differential games, where each agent is assigned an intelligence level corresponding to several thinking iterations. To design more advanced decision-making algorithms that explicitly exploit the learning abilities of the other agents in the environment, a meta-learning framework in games will be presented, via which an autonomous agent can achieve learning manipulation and deception. Finally, I will present data driven actuator and sensor selection algorithms, which choose the actuators and sensors of the ICAS while maximizing resiliency. Specifically, model-free learning-based actuator and sensor selection schemes will be proposed to optimize metrics of controllability, observability, and attack resilience for ICAS. I will show how you can use reinforcement learning to select such sensors and actuators with state and output feedback in continuous and discrete-time systems. I will finally present simulation examples with large-scale systems.BiographyProf. Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis was born in Athens, Greece.

We will focus on the differential game approach to formation control. With this approach the desired formation patterns are achieved by Nash equilibrium strategies in an intrinsic way in the sense that they are only attributed to the inter-agent interaction and geometric properties of the network, where the desired formations are not designated directly in the controller. In the talk we discuss first the use of non-cooperative differential games as framework to achieve non-consensus emergencies. Then we show that antipodal formations and regular polyhedral can be achieved by Nash equilibrium strategies. Finally, we use our approach to study the encirclement control problem involving two groups. We will show that the desired relative configurations arise as the steady state resulting from Nash equilibrium strategies and are achieved in an intrinsic way as well.BiographyProf. Xiaoming Hu was born in Chengdu, China.

s[i++]="Distinguished Lectures^dislec6.html^Distinguished Lecture 6^ On Team Decision Problems with Nonclassical Information StructuresBy Prof. Andreas MalikopoulosCornell University, USAVenue Jinzhou Hall on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Sunday, 18 May 2025 / 10:10 – 11:10 hrsAbstractTeam theory is a mathematical formalism for decentralized stochastic control problems in which a team, consisting of a number of members, cooperates to achieve a common objective. It was developed to provide a rigorous mathematical framework of cooperating members in which all members have the same objective yet different information. In static team problems, the information received by the team members is not affected by the decisions of other team members, while in dynamic team problems, the information of at least one team member is affected by the decisions of other team members. If there is a prescribed order in which team members make decisions, then such a problem is called a sequential team problem. The information structures in sequential team decision problems designate who knows what about the status of the team and are classified as classical, partially nested, and non-classical. In classical information structures, all team members receive the same information and have perfect recall. In partially nested information structures, some team members have a nonempty intersection of their information structures while they have perfect recall. Any information structure that is not classical or partially nested is called nonclassical. In this talk, I consider sequential dynamic team decision problems with nonclassical information structures. First, I will address the problem from the point of view of a manager who seeks to derive the optimal strategy for the team in a centralized process. I provide structural results that yield an information state for the team, which does not depend on the control strategy, and thus, it can lead to a dynamic programming decomposition where the optimization problem is over the space of the teams decisions. I will then provide structural results for each team member that yield an information state that does not depend on their control strategy, and thus, it can lead to a dynamic programming decomposition where the optimization problem for each team member is over the space of their decisions. Finally, I will show that the solution of each team member is the same as the one derived by the manager. Therefore, each team member can derive their optimal strategy, which is also optimal for the team, without the managers intervention.BiographyProf. Andreas Malikopoulos is a Professor in the School of Civil & Environmental Engineering and the Director of the Information and Decision Science Lab at Cornell University.

This phenomenon turns out to be useful in designing distributed algorithms. Understanding this process also provides insights into how robustness emerges within synchronized groups of agents. Finally, we will argue that enforced synchronization can also lead to the consensus of vector fields through parameter adaptation across the agents.BiographyProf. Hyungbo Shim received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Seoul National University.

However, the Transformers quadratic computational complexity — which grows dramatically with input sequence length—makes continuous scaling unsustainable. This challenge requires us to identify sustainable approaches for advancing AI systems toward general artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the brains information processing mechanisms, this report focuses on dendritic spiking neural networks.

s[i++]="Distinguished Lectures^dislec9.html^Distinguished Lecture 9^ Bandit Learning of Equilibriums in Multiplayer GamesBy Prof. Jianghai HuPurdue University, USAVenue Jinzhou Hall on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Sunday, 18 May 2025 / 15:40 – 16:40 hrsAbstractIn multiplayer games, a group of self-interested players aim to optimize their individual objective functions in a non-cooperative manner, where the cost function of a player depends not only on its own actions but also on the actions of others. The study of multiplayer games has grown immensely in recent decades due to their many practical applications such as power markets, traffic management, social resource allocation, etc. Existing methods for tackling multiplayer games often have some restrictive assumptions, e.g., the presence of a central coordinator, willingness of players to share certain information, perfect knowledge of objective functions and/or their gradients, to name a few. In this talk, we propose a bandit online learning framework for solving multiplayer games where each player updates its actions based solely on the sampled values of its objective function, without knowing its functional form, the actions of other players, or even the presence of other players. By drawing inspirations from optimization methods such as extra gradient descent and stochastic approximation, we propose a number of bandit learning algorithms with guaranteed convergence property to Nash equilibrium points of the game under suitable assumptions. For some of these algorithms, the rates of convergence can also be derived. Numerical and practical examples will be given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.BiographyProf. Jianghai Hu received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2003.

s[i++]="Forums^forum1-1.html^Forum 1-1^ Research Progress on Intelligent Decision Making Based on User-Generated Content in the Age of Digital IntelligenceBy Prof. Zeshui XuSichuan University, ChinaVenue Jinzhou Hall on the 2nd FloorDate/Time Saturday, 17 May 2025 / 14:30 – 17:50 hrsAbstractWith the rapid development of mobile technology and the Internet, User-Generated Content (UGC) has become a key carrier for information delivery and knowledge sharing. Yet, UGC data is characterized by individual variability, multi-directional dissemination, multi-source heterogeneity and multi-modal coexistence, which greatly increase the difficulty of collecting, analyzing and applying UGC data. Using artificial intelligence technology to mine the deep value of information contained in massive and fragmented UGC data and convert it into the basis for decision making has become an essential topic to be explored and promoted. In the meantime, probabilistic preference theory, as a theoretical framework that integrates human cognition and objective reality, is able to effectively characterize complex linguistic information and uncover individual cognitive differences. It is of great significance to investigate the UGC-driven probabilistic preference theory for building a decision support system with high adaptability, dynamic adjustment capability, and intelligent features. Hence, this report focuses on the theory and application of intelligent decision making based on UGC and probabilistic preference theory. Specifically, we outline the context of the era in which the UGC data deluge emerged along with the decision analyses driven by it. Next, we introduce the key methods and techniques for characterizing probabilistic preference information under the background of big data. Then, the research progress on intelligent decision making based on UGC and probabilistic preference theory is summarized. Finally, we look into the opportunities and challenges facing this area and provide insights into the future development of intelligent decision making.BiographyProf. Zeshui Xu received the Ph.D. degree in management science and engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003.

Modern engineering control systems increasingly exhibit networked structural characteristics and intelligent unit attributes. Within this context, the concept of multi-agent systems has emerged, with their distributed cooperative control and optimization problems gradually becoming a research frontier in systems and control fields. In practical scenarios, constrained by factors such as limited communication ranges of agents and communication link interference, the communication topologies of multi-agent systems often demonstrate dynamic switching properties. This talk initiates from critical issues in consensus control of multi-agent systems under switching communication topologies, systematically organizing key technical methodologies for addressing these challenges: the common Lyapunov function-based and multiple Lyapunov functions-based methods. For multi-agent systems with directed switching communication topologies, we propose a multiple Lyapunov functions construction framework based on nonsingular M-matrix theory and corresponding consensus criteria. Furthermore, we explore less conservative multiple Lyapunov functions construction approaches through Lyapunov inequalities and optimization techniques. Building upon this foundation, we investigate robust optimization problems for multi-agent systems with physical dynamics under switching communication topologies. Finally, we share applications of these theoretical achievements in formation control of unmanned surface vehicles and provide personal perspectives on emerging research directions in this field.BiographyProf. Guanghui Wen is an Endowed Chair Professor and the Vice Dean of the School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, Deputy Director of Jiangsu National Applied Mathematics Center, and Executive Deputy Director (Acting Director) of Jiangsu Provincial Information Mathematics Application Center.

During super-agility maneuvers, aerodynamic forces demonstrate pronounced nonlinear, unsteady, and strongly coupled characteristics. Accurate modeling of these forces is critical; otherwise, not only will the flight performance be compromised, but the safety of the aircraft cannot be guaranteed. Traditional quasi-steady aerodynamic models fail to adequately capture the aircrafts nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic behavior. While existing approaches like NASAs step response function model and TsAGIs differential equation model incorporate simplified assumptions suitable for basic delta-wing configurations, their effectiveness significantly diminishes for aircraft featuring tail surfaces or canards. Current methodologies also largely neglect static hysteresis effects, resulting in compromised modeling accuracy. This report presents innovative concepts including aerodynamic hysteresis dynamic derivatives and develops nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic equations using dimensionless quantities that characterize flow separation locations. These equations accurately describe both dynamic and static hysteresis effects and can predict static aerodynamic hysteresis based on dynamic test data. In terms of aerodynamic parameter identification, a stepwise identification method using state partitioning is proposed. For aerodynamic hysteresis characteristics, the modeling accuracy reaches 99% based on wind tunnel test data and 95% based on flight test data. It is recommended to conduct research on nonlinear and unsteady dynamic modeling for vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft and flying wing configurations, and to establish theoretical and methodological frameworks for quantifying model accuracy, uncertainty, and generalization capability.BiographyProf. Jihong Zhu, a tenured professor at Tsinghua University, serves as Chief Scientist for multiple national key projects.

The forum will also allow young graduate students to identify open research problems and engage with active researchers in this field.Achieving stability through feedback for dynamical systems is a fundamental concern in control theory and control engineering. This development forum will focus on a special type of stability: finite-time stability, which requires the solutions of a system to converge to a designated equilibrium point within a finite time and remain there thereafter. This represents a much stronger—and in many cases more practically desirable—property than the conventional asymptotic stability, which requires solutions to approach the equilibrium point as time tends to infinity. In many applications, such as multi-agent rendezvous, ABS braking, and missile guidance, ensuring finite -time stability for the dynamical control system is highly desirable.BiographyProf. Zhi-liang Zhao, Doctoral Supervisor, and Dean at the School of Electrical and Control Engineering, North University of China.

This report introduces a Lyapunov-based finite-time small-gain theorem, which is used to analyze the finite-time input-to-state stability (FTISS) of interconnected nonlinear systems composed of two or more subsystems that are individually finite-time input-to-state stable. Specifically, the interconnected system considered in this report consists of several subsystems, each of which is characterized by finite-time input-to-state stability described using a Lyapunov function (referred to as the FTISS Lyapunov function). Under certain small-gain conditions, the FTISS Lyapunov functions of the subsystems can be employed to construct an FTISS Lyapunov function for the overall interconnected system. The key to achieving this result lies in a novel power-function-based scaling transformation, which effectively overcomes the challenge of ensuring that the scaled FTISS Lyapunov function retains a convergence rate less than 1, thereby preserving finite-time convergence.BiographyProf. Tengfei Liu received his Ph.D. from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia, in 2011.

This is of great practical significance in fields that require high control accuracy and convergence speed, such as aerospace, robotics, and autonomous driving. At the same time, the continuous feedback mechanism effectively avoids the high-frequency oscillations commonly encountered in discontinuous control methods, such as sliding mode control. As a result, continuous feedback finite-time control has attracted significant attention and achieved a series of important results. However, continuous output feedback finite-time control faces dual challenges in its development: first, the physical constraint of incomplete system state measurement, and second, the theoretical bottleneck due to the nonlinear design of the controller. Existing research usually requires the assumption that the systems nonlinear dynamics satisfy a sublinear weighted homogeneity condition, which is a relatively stringent condition, excluding common classes of Lipschitz continuous functions and limiting the engineering applicability of the method. In recent years, we have overcome this restrictive condition by introducing composite design methods such as saturation control, switching strategies, and nonlinear dynamic compensation. These methods lead to new semi-global and global continuous output feedback finite-time control design approaches for a broad class of nonlinear systems, and we have rigorously proven the finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system. This report will present the latest theoretical advancements in continuous output feedback finite-time control and discuss its application in constant-time-headway-policy (CTHP) control for platooning vehicles.BiographyProf. Zhi-liang Zhao received B.Sc. from Shaanxi Normal University in 2003, M.Sc. in 2007 from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Ph.D. in 2012 from the University of Science and Technology.

However, existing lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons suffer from issues such as inaccurate dynamic model parameters, insufficient human-exoskeleton movement coordination, and rigid rehabilitation training modes. These limitations lead to low motion control precision, excessive human-exoskeleton interaction torque, and poor adaptability of rehabilitation strategies, ultimately reducing rehabilitation effectiveness, compromising user comfort, and even posing risks of secondary injuries. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic parameter identification method based on an improved whale optimization algorithm, integrating optimized excitation trajectory design to enhance the accuracy of the exoskeletons dynamic model and mitigate the impact of parameter uncertainties on control performance. A gait phase recognition and trajectory generation method based on a central pattern generator (CPG) is developed, leveraging healthy gait data modeling to enable online adjustments of step frequency, step length, and phase, thereby improving human-exoskeleton movement coordination. Additionally, a multimodal human-exoskeleton interaction control method based on an admittance model is introduced, incorporating a variable-admittance active rehabilitation strategy. By integrating modulation factors, this method enables adaptive switching between active, passive, and on-demand assistance modes, enhancing the personalized adaptability of rehabilitation training. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed methods effectively reduce human-exoskeleton interaction torque, improve gait coordination, and enhance rehabilitation training adaptability. Clinical trials further confirm the superiority of exoskeleton-based rehabilitation over traditional rehabilitation approaches.

The inconsistency in information granularity and distribution types between discrete and continuous variables introduces information asymmetry challenge. Mainstream causal discovery and temporal analysis methods, constrained by homogeneous variable assumptions, exhibit significantly limited efficacy in modeling cross-modality coupled mixed data.To address temporal causal discovery and information asymmetry in mixed time series, this study pioneers the original concept of latent continuity recovery, rigorously exploring its theoretical guarantees, feasibility conditions, and technical implementations. We design a novel deep hybrid temporal causal discovery paradigm through variable embedding strategies, model training techniques, and sparse causal mining. This approach overcomes the bottleneck of identifying significant causal structures within unified information granularity and distribution spaces. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 datasets across five Granger causality benchmarks demonstrating superior causal discovery capabilities for real-world high-dimensional, nonlinear, hybrid-variable time-series data.Building on this methodology, we propose more efficient and effective latent continuity recovery strategies and establish the first universal modeling framework for mixed time-series. The framework addresses the problem of high computational burden of exponential operation in Gaussian kernel embedding, and realizes task-oriented latent continuity recovery efficiently and flexibly by introducing inductive bias of temporal convolution, being suitable for larger scale time series data. Technically, it efficiently learns balanced spatiotemporal representations of mixed variables through adversarial/smoothing constraints, and self-cross attention mechanisms. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on 34 real-world datasets across five mainstream tasks: forecasting, classification, regression, imputation, and anomaly detection.Our research work received the Huawei Spark Award and were published in the IEEE TPAMI 2025 and NeurIPS 2024.BiographyProf. Chunhui Zhao, Qiushi Distinguished Professor, Recipient of the National Outstanding Youth Fund.

s[i++]="Yoga Pose Recognition Method based on Invariant Graph Neural Network^MonA01-2.html^Meng Zhang and Qiu YiMin  ^To address the limitations of conventional yoga action recognition systems characterized by poor recognition accuracy due to inherent high inter-class similarity among postures and sub-optimal utilization of skeletal kinematic data, this paper presents YogaGNN: a second-order invariant graph neural network framework for robust skeleton-based pose classification. This method enables scalable graph classification through hierarchical integration of multi-order structural representations while preserving computational efficiency. Our approach employs BlazePose, an advanced estimation framework, to reconstruct 3-dimensional skeletal key points from input images, forming a topological graph where nodes correspond to anatomical landmarks and edges encode kinematic relationships through bone connections. A feature encoder generates node-specific attributes by synergistically fusing geometric (3D Euclidean coordinates) and topological (skeletal articulation angles) descriptors. To enhance feature propagation and mitigate model complexity, this paper introduces convolution shortcut connections within and between invariant graph convolution layers. These residual pathways facilitate gradient flow optimization while preserving discriminative information across graph convolution operations.

s[i++]="Chained Prediction Algorithm for Multi-Spatial Knowledge Graphs^MonA01-3.html^Ming-hui Wang, Peng-qi Wu, Li-na Xiao, Yu-Song and Jian-wei Liu  ^Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used in various fields. However, current available knowledge graph embedding models struggle to effectively capture the connections between entities and their physical properties within the knowledge graph. To enhance the models representation and embedding capabilities, the input space should accurately reflect the connective features within the knowledge graph. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel knowledge graph chaining prediction algorithm—the Chained Prediction Algorithm for Multi-Spatial Knowledge Graphs (CPA-MSKG). This algorithm effectively improves the representation capability of knowledge graphs by mapping entity-relation fact triples to both Euclidean space and complex frequency domain. The CPA-MSKG model combines embeddings from real-number space and complex frequency domain, which not only enhances the ability to capture the complexity of entities and relationships but also demonstrates significant advantages when handling different types of relationships. Through an in-depth investigation of the role of Fourier transform in the model, this study reveals the potential of this transformation in capturing implicit features and improving the efficiency of feature learning. Experimental results indicate that CPA-MSKG performs exceptionally well in head and tail entity prediction tasks, especially when dealing with complex relationships, where the fluctuations in prediction results are minimal, indicating high stability. This validates the effectiveness of bilinear mapping in entity relationship prediction and demonstrates the models robustness in capturing subtle interactions within the knowledge graph, providing a reliable foundation for various knowledge-based applications.  <i>Keywords: </i>Knowledge graphs, Chained prediction, Multi-spatial knowledge graphs, Fourier transform.

To address this issue, we propose a novel deep residual shrinkage proximal-point mapping network (RSPPM-Net) aimed at enhancing image reconstruction performance through feature denoising. The innovation of RSPPM-Net lies in its integration of stochastic gradient descent modules and localized residual shrinkage proximal mapping modules, effectively reducing the interference of redundant features. Additionally, the network introduces a cascading module called the Fourier residual shrinkage block (FRSBlock) to correct potential biases between the input and output signals. FRSBlock integrates a residual FFT block and two identical adaptive blocks, each formed by cascading a global average pooling layer, a fully connected layer, a batch normalization layer, and an activation function. Through this architecture, FRSBlock can adaptively generate and adjust denoising thresholds based on the input data, achieving localized multi-level denoising and precise signal correction.

In current research on Dynamic Magnetic Flux Leakage (DMFL) testing technology, given the unique structure of ACSR conductors, the velocity effect often leads to a decline in the detectors ability to locate and quantify defects. This paper proposes the Dynamic Electromagnetic Eddy Current (DMEC) testing method to address this issue. By introducing differential coils to weaken the demagnetization effect in DMFL and enhance the magnetization level of the system, the testing sensitivity is improved. The optimized sensor possesses dual testing capabilities for eddy currents and magnetic flux leakage, reducing the axial positioning error of defects, improving the identification ability of defect location layers, and refining the quantification of defect sizes. Additionally, besides the trigger edge of the pulsed excitation signal, the high-level signal can also characterize defects during motion, significantly increasing the defect testing coverage rate. This method utilizes dynamic electromagnetic composite sensors to accurately detect detailed information about defects, potentially enabling high-speed non- destructive inspection of ACSR conductors.  <i>Keywords: </i>Aluminum conductor steel reinforced, Speed effect, Dynamic pulsed electromagnetic, Finite element analysis, Defect quantification.  <sup>1</sup>College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. <sup>2</sup>College of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."

However, traditional evacuation models typically focus on physical factors such as speed, density, and the number of exits, often neglecting the complex psychological and behavioral interactions among pedestrians. In particular, the impact of panic and cooperative behaviors on evacuation efficiency in emergency situations is frequently neglected. To address this gap, this paper proposes a game-theoretic approach integrated with a force-driven cellular automata model, which incorporates cooperative behaviors during evacuation. To enhance the utilization of each exit and reduce congestion, we design an evacuation guidance assistant based on density control. Moreover, to quantify the cooperative and competitive dynamics between pedestrians, the proposed model incorporates panic degree and conflict cost into the game-theoretic framework. Experimental results reveal that panic significantly hinders the formation of cooperative behaviors, with its impact on evacuation efficiency being most pronounced in the initial stages of the evacuation. While moderate levels of panic can enhance evacuation efficiency, excessively high panic levels have a detrimental effect, slowing down the process.

s[i++]="A New Fuzzy Noise Management Method in Recommender Systems^MonA07-5.html^Pu Ji and Lei Liu  ^An efficient and accurate recommender system (RS) recommends a list of items that users may prefer according to their historical ratings. Its performance depends not only on the recommendation method but also on data reliability. Most methods assume that user ratings are consistent. However, due to differences in users; personal conditions, emotional states, or contexts, natural noise is likely produced by non-malicious users, which limits the improvement of recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a new noise detection method based on single-valued neutrosophic numbers (SVNNs) and a new noise correction method based on difference degree classification to manage natural noise in ratings. This method resolves the issue of unreliable data. In addition, it is tested on two benchmark datasets. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed noise management method.

Previous research either lacked precision or employed models too large for clinical utility. With the advent of EGE-UNet, a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark was achieved in skin lesion segmentation, while also constraining model size to 50KB. However, in pursuit of ultra-compact models, EGE-UNets methods for shallow and deep feature extraction appeared overly simplistic, lacking comprehensive feature representation. Inspired by this, we propose a network with more comprehensive feature extraction capabilities, while still maintaining a low model size and achieving higher accuracy. We integrate Hierarchical Aggregated Cross Convolutional Network (HACCN), Multi-Feature Fusion Skip Connection (MFSC), and Efficient Attention Module (EAT) into the EGE-UNet framework, forming a novel model. HACCN enhances the expressive power of convolutional blocks by simulating self-attention within them. In the MFSC module, we reexamine skip connections to allow communication between shallow and deep feature maps, enriching semantic features and intricate details. Efficient Attention enables efficient attention mechanisms to act on deep network feature maps, capturing global dependencies.

Some samples might have abnormal conditions like water stains and overexposure. But since this deviation is within the predefined qualified range, theyre still considered qualified. We call these samples marginally qualified samples. One specific challenge in our work is the models accurate identification ability for marginally qualified samples: generating embeddings and doing outlier detection using only nominal (non-defective) example images. However, in actual industrial scenarios, many marginally qualified samples differ from the example images. Their inconsistent features will affect the final detection accuracy. Traditional anomaly detection methods would judge marginally qualified samples as anomalies. In this paper, weve expanded on embedding-based anomaly detection and proposed MDL (Masking-based Distinguishing Learning of Marginally Qualified Data). It models and sorts the nominal block features into the real non-defective feature memory bank and the marginally qualified sample feature memory bank to accurately judge marginally qualified samples as normal. Additionally, weve introduced marginally qualified data supplementation. This can accurately generate a large number of marginally qualified samples and nominal samples to simulate the distribution of real industrial normal samples. MDL can be integrated into any embedding-based anomaly detection framework and has achieved advanced performance in both anti-interference detection and localization.

The modeling accuracy of a DEH model is closely linked to the choice of mathematical functions, such as the causal operator in the Duhem model. However, current selection methods often rely on trial-and-error approaches, resulting in inefficiency and limited insight. In this paper, a hierarchical Shapley value method is proposed for selecting mathematical functions in the DEH model, aiming to enhance modeling accuracy and improve interpretability. To achieve this, a general DEH framework is developed, building on the Bouc-Wen model. A Taylor series approximation is used to derive the discrete structure to facilitate model selection. Furthermore, to reduce algorithmic complexity, a nonuniform node decomposition strategy is introduced, along with a threshold-based function selection mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on a dielectric elastomer platform.  <i>Keywords: </i>Interpretable differential equation-based model, Hierarchical Shapley value, Equation structure selector, Hysteresis nonlinearity.

Emphasis is placed on achieving global interception of a moving target, even in the absence of target velocity information. Inspired by the mutual attraction between opposite charges, an interception mechanism is proposed to ensure that the MSV globally intercepts the escaping target from any initial position. To handle the unknown velocity, that is the MSV cannot acquire any priori knowledge of target velocity, an adaptive velocity estimation algorithm is designed by providing estimates of upper bound of unknown target velocity rather than the velocity itself. Based on this, the interception controller is then derived via the backstepping framework.

The self-disturbance and external disturbance factors of the system, such as load aging and system input voltage drop step change, hinder the widespread application of DWC systems for electric vehicles. This paper designs a hybrid disturbance rejection control strategy for the DWC system to provide electric vehicles with stable voltage output and a wide range of voltage gain. Specifically, the designed linear active disturbance rejection controller ensures the constant input voltage of the full-bridge inverter through a linear extended state observer, a linear state feedback control law, and a disturbance compensation link; the hybrid controller adjusts the load output voltage stability and the system voltage gain wide range regulation by adjusting the switching frequency and phase shift angle of the full-bridge inverter.

The conventional methods of loop closure detection leveraging Bag of Words(BoW) to detect loop closure are low accuracy and the accumulated errors are significant. Semantic information is deeply integrated into SLAM and provides object-level features to aid loop closure.

In real-world situations, large-scale environments are prone to encountering with the challenges of high time cost generally. Furthermore, when dealing with large-scale mapping tasks, existing SLAM algorithms suffer from the difficulties such as high computational complexity, significant memory consumption and substantial cumulative drift. To enhance the mapping efficiency and accuracy of vehicles, this paper proposes a topological feature based multi-vehicle cooperative mapping method tailored for large-scale environments. By the method, the master vehicle conducts preliminary fusion through the first-round feature matching. By clustering the boundary points in the preliminarily fused map to obtain the exploration points for the vehicles, an exploration-point model containing topological features is established to construct a cost function for the exploration points. Then appropriate exploration points are assigned to corresponding vehicle to perform next round exploring task, and each vehicle updates its local map according to the assigned exploration tasks and shares it with the master vehicle. Finally, the master vehicle calculates the attitude transformation between the local maps based on the exploration - point model, and emerge the local-maps to obtain the global map.

Whole-body pose estimation provides fine-grained information for human-centric perception and generation applications. However, whole-body pose estimation is still a challenging task because the number of whole-body keypoints is large and their definitions are complex. The keypoints of body parts represent varying fine-grained semantics, which leads to the difficulty of simultaneously locating keypoints of different body parts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mask-guided feature aggregation method to learn fine-grained semantic contents. Specifically, we introduce the fine-grained feature interaction in the coordinate classification paradigm to improve the semantic details of keypoint representations. We leverage the semantic segmentation supervision to learn pixel-level contents and utilize the segmentation mask to guide the feature interaction to focus on fine-grained areas.

To address the challenge of predicting the load intervals of governor oil pumps, this paper integrates the strengths of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer models to construct an LSTM-Transformer forecasting model for the load intervals of governor oil pumps in pumped-storage units. In this study, LSTM is used to capture the dynamic correlation between the governor oil pump load interval at different moments and other features such as unit speed and guide vane opening, and then take advantage of Transformers self-attention mechanism to establish a global dependency between the dimensions of the input features, which is able to adaptively pay attention to the importance weights between the dimensions of the different features, and to mine the features for the deep-level correlation information between features, thereby combining the advantages of LSTM and Transformer to more accurately predict the load intervals of the governors oil pump.

After the occlusion is removed, the algorithm fuses all the positioning point data to correct the target position, and adjusts the prediction model parameters through error analysis to further optimize the performance.

s[i++]="A Cascading Driven Multi-Object Tracking Algorithm Based on StrongSORT^MonB07-1.html^Keyu Chen, Xiaogang Wang, Binghan Zhan, Liuhong Zhang, Zhiwei Yin and Jiacai Yan  ^Multi-object tracking(MOT) algorithms aim to accurately locate and track multiple objects across consecutive video frames while maintaining consistent object identities. Currently, mainstream MOT algorithms often leverage appearance information to assist filtering algorithms in accomplishing MOT tasks. However, this idea primarily relies on appearance information of the objects. When objects repeatedly enter and exit the lens or undergo appearance changes, the objects may have ID switches, leading to the failures of the MOT task. Based on this, this paper proposes a cascading driven multi-object tracking algorithm based on StrongSORT. Firstly, a lower part of body appearance information matching module and a skeleton information matching module are designed to address the issue of object appearance changes. These two modules are independent and are integrated with the original matching module in a cascading method through computing the joint costs respectively. Secondly, this paper replaces the detector with YOLOv7 and employs OSnet to extract object appearance features. The best features are preserved for a longer time by a long-term memory mechanism proposed in this paper, enhancing the robustness of the tracker when the object repeatedly enters and exits the lens. Additionally, a custom dataset is built to test the algorithm proposed in this paper. Compared to the original algorithm, the number of ID switches has been reduced by 20%, the identity recognition performance has improved by 7.07%, and the tracking performance has increased by 6.11%.

Nevertheless, the persisting challenge lies in accurately conducting genomic profiling of lung cancer using a single biopsy sample, given the inherent tumor heterogeneity. To address this issue, an innovative approach using similaritybased multimodal data fuzzy fusion was presented to predict EGFR mutation. Initially, radiomics features were extracted from computerized tomography scans to quantitatively characterize tumors within the region of interest. Subsequently, three independent fundamental learners were trained based on preprocessed multimodal medical data. Once these fundamental learners generate membership degrees, fuzzy sets for EGFR genotyping were established. The Tanimoto coefficient was then employed to evaluate the similarity between the membership degrees of observed cases and ideal solutions. Ultimately, de-fuzzification through similarity ranking yielded a robust prediction for the EGFR mutation. The proposed multimodal medical data fuzzy fusion demonstrates promising predictive performance, achieving an area under curve value of 0.8878 in an independent test cohort.

However, the scarcity of labeled samples in practical applications poses a significant challenge, making few-shot learning a critical solution. To address the limitations of traditional methods that rely solely on unimodal information, this paper proposes a Semantic-Guided Prototype Refinement method (SGPR), which incorporates multimodal information into the few-shot learning framework. Specifically, the method leverages the visual encoder of the CLIP model to extract initial image features, which are further refined through a shallow network to generate fine-tuned features. The fine-tuned features are then fused with the initial features to construct the image prototype representation. Simultaneously, a large language model is used to enrich the information of label text. The textual information is extracted via the CLIP text encoder and processed through a shallow network with shared weights to generate text prototypes. Finally, a cross-modal prototype alignment strategy is employed to further optimize the image prototypes under semantic constraints, enabling efficient classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves classification performance in tasks with only five labeled samples per class, fully validating its effectiveness and superiority in addressing the challenges of few-shot apple leaf disease recognition.  <i>Keywords: </i>Apple leaf disease recognition, Multimodal, Few-shot learning.

Simultaneously, a neural network independently estimates the rough surface normal. The correction algorithm is then applied to accurately correct errors in the normal direction and to resolve ambiguities caused by polarization. This algorithm integrates the rough normal estimated by the neural network with the normal derived from polarization, which provides an effective approach to improve the accuracy of normal recovery.

Therefore, providing a rapid and accurate initial orbit determination(IOD) scheme for DROs is a critical step in Earth-Moon space situational awareness. Given the instability of traditional IOD methods when simultaneously addressing the challenges of DROs and very short arcs(VSA), this paper proposes an IOD method based on constructing an Admissible Region(AR) from DRO characteristic parameters. This method sequentially constructs ARs based on characteristic parameters in both the inertial coordinate system and the synodic coordinate system to constrain the solution space. Within the final AR, an optimization algorithm based on observation-minuscomputation( OC) residuals is utilized, integrating and predicting solutions while minimizing residuals, ultimately producing accurate DRO orbital data.

The cases of equilibrium change are considered in system modeling and control design, and the regional stability concept is given together with an equilibrium state-related multi-Lyapunov approach, which facilitates the further control transition, unlike the conventional switched system with common equilibrium stabilization requirement regardless of the change of trim control inputs. The smoothly switched controller is designed by interpreting gains, equilibrium state, and control input together in the continuous-time domain rather than converting the differential dynamic model into discrete cases and ignoring the possible equilibrium state and control input change. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controller are demonstrated through numerical examples and a simulation for the task of airdrop and recovery of a fixed-wing aircraft.  <i>Keywords: </i>Switched systems, Smooth switched control design, Multiple equilibria.

Traditional Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Networks (MFPN) can capture rich semantic information but inevitably lose spatial details during the down-sampling of feature maps, thereby limiting segmentation accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes a Receptive-Field Attention Feature Enhancement Module that utilizes cosine similarity between different vectors to enhance similar features beneficial for pixel classification before downsampling. This module dynamically allocates convolutional kernel weights based on the importance of image features within the receptive field, thereby enhancing the networks feature extraction capabilities and mitigating the adverse effects of downsampling.

The uncertainty in dynamic environments and mobile users imposes several challenges to the link stability in FSO and especially hinders the control policy in beam alignment and tracking. Recent efforts have illustrated the benefits of involving deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in dynamic controlling, yet which of the two mainstream branches, i.e., deterministic and stochastic policies, prevails remains questionable. To this end, we in this paper propose to leverage both deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to advance robust alignment and precise tracking for FSO beams, enhancing the quality of service. Through training conducted in highfidelity dynamic environments, the UAV transmitter agents have demonstrated the capability to rapidly sustain stable FSO links, with both methods capable of reducing the interruption rate to below 30%. Comparative analysis reveals that while the PPO algorithm achieves faster training and quicker adaptation to new environments, the DDPG algorithm offers greater stability.

The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution provides a flexible framework for modeling and analyzing strategic interactions, capturing both transitive and intransitive preferences, and accommodating reversible and irreversible decisions.

This method took into account the external disturbance factors existing in the actual systems. In the design process of interconnected system state observers, disturbance effect on state estimation is further decreased by designing performance indexes, which results in the design of state feedback controller. In order to achieve better state estimations and robust control effects, a new performance index was introduced to further shorten the robust stabilization time of error system and state feedback closedloop system. The stability of the developed interconnected system was proved by using Lyapunov theory. Sufficient conditions for state observer and robust controller were given in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulation examples of interconnected systems were given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which was found to be superior to the methods previously reported in the literature.  <i>Keywords: </i>State observer, Nonlinear interconnected system, Controller, Linear matrix inequalities, Robust stabilization.

s[i++]="Rotor Position Estimation Strategy for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Based on Event-Triggered Singular Value Decomposition Cubature Kalman Filter^MonBIS-28.html^GuoCheng Zeng and Yangbin Zhang  ^Accurate rotor position is the key to realize vector control of permanent magnet synchronous motor. Traditional methods rely on high-precision position sensors, but such sensors are expensive and lack adaptability. The use of observer method to obtain rotor position and speed is easily affected by factors such as motor body temperature rise and parameter perturbation, which affects the estimation accuracy. Low-resolution Hall sensor has the advantages of low cost, convenient debugging and replacement, and strong antiinterference. It is a transitional solution between sensor and sensorless. Therefore, this paper proposes a new rotor position estimation strategy based on the combination of Hall sensor and observer. First, the sliding mode observer is designed based on the motor fundamental wave mathematical model and Lyapunov stability. Then, for the complex working conditions of the motor, the first-order acceleration method based on Hall sensor is derived and designed; finally, this paper derives and designs the singular value decomposition cubature Kalman filter and induces event triggering mechanism to reduce the amount of calculation.

This study breaks new ground by presenting a revolutionary non-singular fastterminal sliding-mode controller (NFTSMC). NFTSMC introduced here represents a paradigm shift in control design. Its approach rate function, a distinct innovation, combines a switching function that governs the approach phase and an exponential function that prevails during the sliding stage. Coupled with a uniquely improved non- singular fast- terminal slidingmode surface, this NFTSMC, when integrated as a speed loop, effectively curtails the speed overshoot and markedly elevates the systems anti-interference capabilities. Subsequently, an innovative leap forward is made with the introduction of the Improved Sliding-Mode Observer (ISMO). Through an unprecedented optimization of the observer design, the system can achieve sensor-less operation by precisely estimating the rotational speed and rotor position using ISMO. Ultimately, the simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink serve as irrefutable proof of the superiority of this novel approach.

A modified signal is utilized to enhance a time-based scalar function as a prescribed-time performance indicator, where the boundary of the improved function adapts based on the discrepancy between the actual input and the desired control signal. This adjustment minimizes the requirement for predefined traching precision under input saturation, thus mitigating the rish of singularities. Subsequently, a mode-specific event-triggering mechanism, utilizing a logarithmic relative threshold, is designed to interact with the performance function. This approach helps mitigate the effects of asynchronous transitions resulting from both event-triggering and system mode changes.

First, to minimize reliance on prior task knowledge, task-specific and human-centric features are integrated into a unified cost function, and impedance parameters are optimized using a reinforcement learning algorithm. Then, these optimized impedance parameters are utilized to generate a dynamic trajectory optimization loop, which adjusts the trajectory to achieve the intended impedance behavior. Later, to enhance trajectory tracking accuracy and minimize control input signal jitter, a sliding model controller is developed, with its stability rigorously validated through the Lyapunov function. Finally, simulation results confirm the proposed method�s effectiveness and stability.  <i>Keywords: </i>Reinforcement learning, Impedance control, Sliding mode control, Fruit teleoperation picking robot.

However, this approach faces challenges in accurately capturing intricate and pronounced specular effects, particularly in complex scenes. In this paper, we present a novel method GS-SE to address the problem associated with novel view synthesis of reflective objects, which can be considers as a hybrid model that integrates Gaussians with Signed Distance Fields (SDF) within a deferred shading framework. The core element of our method is an environment map reflection model, which requires highly precise normal vectors for reflection direction computation, but provides minimal gradient information for refining these normals. To this end, we introduce a mutual supervision mechanism in which deferred Gaussians and SDF mutually supervise each other through depth and normal information. This mechanism ensures that the learned deferred Gaussians are more effectively constrained, with minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, we utilize a novel opacity encoding scheme that dynamically adjusts the opacity of Gaussians depending on the viewing direction in order to capture significant viewdependent changes more effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that GS-SE is highly competitive in terms of rendering quality, reconstruction accuracy, and training efficiency. This advancement expands the applicability of 3DGS, enabling it to effectively handle complex scenes with specular and reflective surfaces.  <i>Keywords: </i>Gaussian splatting, Novel view synthesis, Deferred shading, Neural rendering.  <sup>1</sup>Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. <sup>2</sup>College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. <sup>3</sup>College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China."

It can be modeled as a multi-agent problem due to the inherent cooperative and competitive interactions among advertisers in each auction. Previous works cluster advertisers and assign an agent to each cluster, ignoring the interaction among different advertisers within the same cluster. Furthermore, there is little research on how to avoid unsafe interactions with the online environment while applying multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Model-Based reinforcement learning framework for auto-Bidding (MAMBB) and characterize each advertiser as an agent directly. MAMBB adopts the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution.

As results, a lot of algorithms have been developed for solving the TVUDLMVE. Some algorithms originally proposed for solving static problems have also been applied to solving time-varying problems. For example, traditional methods, such as Gaussian elimination method, Newton method, and quasi- Newton method, can also be used to solve the TVUDLMVE, but they introduce large lag errors. With the rapid development of neural dynamics, some dynamics methods in the form of recurrent neural dynamics, such as gradient dynamics (GD), has been presented to solve the TVUDLMVE. However, those methods do not eliminate large lag error either. Afterwards, Zhang et al proposed Zhang dynamics (ZD) and the gradient Zhang dynamics (GZD) successively, which are different from both traditional methods and the GD, in solving time-varying problems. These two new kinds of dynamics completely (or almost completely) eliminate lag errors theoretically. Subsequently, Zhang et al proposed the reciprocal Zhang dynamics (RZD) to avoid computing the pseudoinverse of a coefficient matrix. In this paper, we present a continuous RZD model for solving the TVUDLMVE. Two different time-discretization algorithms are obtained by discretizing the continuous GD model and the continuous RZD model with Euler forward discretization formula.

In this context, encrypted observations represent a situation where the intruder and the supervisor have different observation capabilities: the intruder can observe both unencrypted and encrypted event signals but cannot interpret the encrypted ones, while the supervisor has decryption capability and full access to the original event signals. To model the encryption effects, we construct an encrypted automaton. By combining the original system with the observer of its encrypted automaton, we develop an augmented E-observer, which is then used to verify current state E-opacity.

The disturbances arising from the variation of translational motion and model uncertainties in attitude angle loop are regarded as lumped disturbance and addressed by using a fixed-time extended state observer (FESO). An adaptive fixed-time radial basis function neural network disturbance observer (FRBFNNDO) is designed to compensate the stern stream disturbance, model uncertainties and actuator faults in angular rate loop and achieve fault-tolerant control.

During the controller design process, there are two main challenges that are often encountered: the singularity problem and the unknown nonlinear term. To solve the above aforementioned difficulty, this paper adopts special piecewise functions at each step of the backstepping process to avoid the singularity of the control signals. Meanwhile, radial basis function neural networks are used to estimate the unknown nonlinear term and simplify the handling process of the nonstrict-feedback form. Subsequently, based on the predefined time stochastic control theory, a novel adaptive switching controller is constructed by using the common Lyapunov function, such that the average settling time does not exceed the chosen positive real number in advance (predefined finite time). Its worth mentioning that the designed controller can ensure the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. In addition, the theoretical analysis shows that the tracking error between the reference signal and the actual output can converge to zero before the predefined finite time. Finally, the simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed switching controller.  <i>Keywords: </i>Switched stochastic systems, Predefined time tracking, Common Lyapunov function, A RLC circuit, Singularity issue, Nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems.

s[i++]="A Novel Adaptive Non-Singular Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Robotic Arms^MonC16-6.html^Manqiang Liu and Meng Zhang  ^The research in this paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control problem of a novel robotic arm system under actuator faults and unknown disturbances. In order to improve the system performance, an innovative adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode control method integrating an actuator fault compensation mechanism is proposed. The core of the method lies in the design of a disturbance observer-based controller capable of estimating modelling errors and external disturbances. The controller adopts the tanh(s) function instead of the sign(s) function, which effectively reduces the jitter of the control input. At the same time, an adaptive rate is introduced to estimate and compensate for unknown disturbances and uncertainty parameters, and combined with an auxiliary control algorithm to compensate for actuator faults and system friction, so as to optimise the dynamic performance of the closed-loop system. The convergence of the closed-loop error system is demonstrated through Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation experiments of the two-link robotic arm verify that the controller has excellent fault-tolerant control performance under actuator failure, which not only demonstrates good trajectory tracking capability, but also observes the joint perturbations in real time. In summary, the control method proposed in this paper performs well in terms of rapidity, stability, anti-interference and fault tolerance, and provides an effective solution for the trajectory tracking control of the new robotic arm system.  <i>Keywords: </i>Robotic arm, Novel, Trajectory tracking, Interference observer, Non-singular terminal sliding mode.

However, it remains unclear how the coupled dynamics of partner adjusting and infectious diseases behave if individuals cannot obtain accurate information on individuals beyond their neighborhoods. To address this issue, we propose a mini model of co-evolutionary SIS model in which individuals are allowed to switch their connections from infectious partners to any other ones in dependence on their densities besides the evolution of epidemic processes. Interestingly, we have found that the disease-free equilibrium is still stable for a considerably large and reasonable parameter regions even if the individuals have such limited cognitive abilities on the state of others except their neighbors. Besides, we have also shown that such a networked system also exhibits rich bifurcation behaviors such as hysteresis bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, and transcritical bifurcation.

Traditional methods often struggle to effectively capture the local topological features of nodes in complex networks due to their limitations in handling nonlinear relationships. This paper proposes a community detection algorithm based on the number of triangles formed by nodes, integrated with graph neural networks (GNNs). The algorithm determines whether nodes belong to the same community by evaluating the number of triangles formed between a node and its neighboring nodes. The goal is to effectively capture local topological features within the network and improve community detection performance. First, a similarity matrix is constructed based on the triangle counts between nodes, fully utilizing the local clustering features of triangles to characterize the relationships between nodes. Then, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to build the model, and experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm.

This study proposes a more effective approach for identifying these critical edges in disease transmission. We introduce four commonly used indicators, including edge degree centrality, edge betweenness centrality, the metric that combines the degree and betweenness centrality of edges to evaluate their importance, and the Fiedler value. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied to assign appropriate weights to each indicator, thus creating a comprehensive strategy for identifying key edges. Additionally, we rank these edges by their significance across various strategies and remove their functionality to prevent their involvement in disease transmission pathways. We employ compartment models, such as SIS and SIR, to simulate disease spread within three network models: Watts-Strogatz small-world, Barab&#225;si-Albert scale-free, and modular networks. The results from numerical simulations demonstrate that our comprehensive strategy is more effective in identifying key edges that influence peak transmission rates and stop the spread of disease compared to conventional methods.

Super-Resolution (SR) reconstruction techniques can significantly enhance image quality. However, SR reconstruction predominantly relies on unidirectional propagation, which causes a loss of perceptual capacity in deeper layers. This leads to the degradation of local features between layers, making it difficult to effectively improve the networks ability to express intricate features. To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Local Information Reinforcement-based CT Image SR network (HLIR) for CT image super-resolution reconstruction. The HLIR consists of three main components: the Cascaded Residual Enhancement Module (CREM), the Multi-Path Hierarchical Feature Augmentation Module (MHFAM), and the Feature Adaptive Attention Mechanism (FAAM). CREM enhances the utilization of residual information through effective residual connections. MHFAM captures the dependency relationships of features at different depths and adaptively adjusts the weights of intermediate layer features, thereby improving the ability to capture key information. FAAM combines channel and spatial attention mechanisms to effectively integrate deep features. Qualitative and quantitative results show that HLIR outperforms recent SR methods in terms of visual quality and error reduction. It effectively recovers detailed information in LDCT images, providing superior performance compared to other methods in both PSNR and SSIM metrics.

A key feature of the design is the inherent trade-off between the convergence domain and the inter-execution interval: by tuning adjustable parameter, the convergence domain can be expanded, albeit at the cost of a longer inter-execution interval. This flexibility allows for tailored performance based on specific system requirements. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  <i>Keywords: </i>Multi-channel system, Distributed observer, Event-triggered mechanism, Cooperative control.

However, trajectory planning for suspendedload unmanned aerial vehicles in complex environments remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a framework for rapidly generating optimal trajectories that minimize payload swing and maximize stability. The trajectory planning problem is decomposed into two main parts: front-end path search and backend nonlinear trajectory optimization. The front-end generates an initial collision-free path without considering the payload swing. The back-end employs a gradient-based optimization algorithm to enhance the trajectory’s smoothness while taking into account the feasibility of the trajectory and the swing dynamics of the suspended payload. This method ensures that the quadrotor maintains stability while tracking the trajectory, optimizing the overall system performance. The proposed approach is validated in complex simulation environments, verifying its feasibility and real-time response in the quadrotor system.  <i>Keywords: </i>Unmanned aerial vehicles, Trajectory generation, Aerial load transportation, Collision avoidance.

s[i++]="SHLDKE: Semantic Hierarchical Low-Dimensional Embedding on the Sphere Space^MonD07-5.html^Ming-Hui Wang, Jian-Wei Liu, Peng-Qi Wu, Li-Na Xiao and Yu-Song  ^The objective of knowledge graph embedding is to represent entities and relationships as low-dimensional vectors, matrices, tensors, etc. However, existing knowledge graph embedding models that model symmetric or antisymmetric, inversion, and synthesis patterns do not adequately capture the physical structure and semantic hierarchy of fact triples. Moreover, due to the simplicity and inefficiency of many tensorbased representation methods, increasing the dimensionality of the embedding space is often required to enhance the expressiveness of the representations. However, this has a negative impact on the scalability of the models. To address these issues, we propose a new model called Semantically Hierarchical and Low-Dimensional Knowledge Embedding (SHLDKE). SHLDKE first embeds the fact triples into the sphere model, utilizing the modulus, phase angle, and elevation angle to represent triplet information, and projects them onto the XOY, XOZ, and YOZ planes for hierarchical semantic learning. This approach not only fully utilizes the semantic level information of fact triples but also significantly reduces the number of embedding dimensions, thereby mitigating scalability issues that may arise when dealing with large knowledge bases. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model SHLDKE can be transformed into TransE and RotatE, indicating that it possesses the convenience of TransE and the rotational characteristics of RotatE. Experimental results demonstrate that SHLDKE can effectively model semantic hierarchies in knowledge graphs and significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for link prediction tasks.  <i>Keywords: </i>Knowledge graph, Low-dimensional embedding representation, Spherical space, Embedding representation.

To address the limitations of long-sequence modeling and multi-channel feature fusion in few-shot ECG classification tasks, this study proposes an innovative model to enhance classification performance and effectively tackle the challenge of data scarcity. We designed a model named FAN-Mamba, which integrates the State Space Model (SSM) module and the Frequency-Aware Network (FAN) module to efficiently extract the long-sequence dependencies and frequency-domain features of ECG signals.

Feature reorganization aims to enhance the models discriminative ability by highlighting relevant facial expression features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach, combining the improved GhostNet and feature reorganization, outperforms traditional FER models in both accuracy and efficiency.

First, DRNet replaces the traditional residual neural network by employing fewer Batch Normalization and Rectified Linear Unit layers, while enhancing the extraction of image receptive field features through strategically designed, larger-sized depthwise separable convolutions. Second, the Cluster EIoU Non-Maximum Suppression algorithm is introduced to replace the conventional Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm. This modification effectively incorporates geometric factors into the suppression process, reducing excessive suppression of bounding boxes for occluded objects. Third, the EIoU loss function is adopted to replace the original Smooth L1 loss, accelerating network convergence and improving bounding box regression accuracy. The proposed model is pre-trained on the publicly available MS COCO datasets and evaluated on multiple occlusion datasets with varying degrees of object overlap. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline Mask R-CNN network, with the proposed algorithm achieving gains of 1.7% in Box AP and 1.3% in Mask AP on the COCO validation set. Furthermore, the model substantially improves bounding box detection accuracy and mask segmentation accuracy for heavily occluded objects.

Due to the complexity and diversity of industrial Internet of Things(IoT) scenarios, the message transmission of IoT devices is very different from that of traditional Internet scenarios. The scale and openness of IoT networks make them extremely vulnerable to security vulnerabilities and attacks, such as malicious traffic attacks. However, most existing abnormal traffic detection systems do not consider the attack methods of Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) abnormal traffic. In order to bridge this gap, in this paper, we proposed an intrusion detection method combining a Bidirectional Flow Integration (BiFi) algorithm and a MQTT Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) model to address the unique challenges of MQTT traffic in IoT networks. BiFi efficiently integrates bidirectional traffic to represent complete communication sessions, while MVAE reduces data dimensionality and classifies abnormal traffic.

The core contribution of this study is the proposal of a new method, DiffDDet (Diffusion Modelbased Directional Target Detection), which not only achieves target detection but, more importantly, provides directional information of the targets, which is lacking in traditional target detection technologies. DiffDDet improves upon the DiffusionDet target detection method by outputting directional information of targets alongside bounding boxes and target categories, and by considering the cyclic nature of directions, it improves the computation method of the sigmoid focal loss function, making it better adapted to learning directions. Furthermore, to further enhance the efficiency of sorting path planning, we have improved the traditional genetic algorithm and developed a new path planning algorithm. This algorithm optimizes genetic operations by intervening in the initial generation of the population with the nearest neighbor algorithm, significantly improving the speed and adaptability of path planning, making it particularly suitable for robotic arm sorting tasks.

The key difficulty the concerned problem faces is that under the action of intermittent impulses, the reachability of the conventional linear sliding surface is destroyed. To overcome this obstacle, first, under a nonsingular transformation, the system is decoupled to a regular form. Second. an impulse interval partitioning strategy-based time-varying switching function is proposed, which adapts to the length of the impulse interval. Through designing the time-varying gain matrices, the continuity of the proposed switching function can be ensured. Then, an ASMC law is designed during the analysis of sliding motion, thus the reduced-order sliding mode dynamics can be obtained.

To meet these demands, satellites need to exhibit high maneuverability and stability during mission execution. However, in complex scenarios such as multi-object observation, where rapid attitude changes are required, executing autonomous on-orbit observation tasks and achieving rapid attitude maneuvers while ensuring high precision and stability remains a major technical challenge. To achieve rapid autonomous observation of key regions of multiple targets, the first problem to solve is attitude path planning, or the task of specifying the attitude control objectives.

Ideally, a notch filter should embody the inverse model of the resonant peak. However, the conventional design of notch filters requires an advanced meticulous identification of the motion systems resonance peak, a process that is both time-consuming and arduous. Inspired by the iterative tuning of feedforward control parameters, this paper introduces a preliminary notch filter parameter tuning method based on the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. This method leverages intelligent optimization algorithms to fine-tune the numerator and denominator parameters of the transfer function, obviating the need for the linear-in-the-parameters model required in traditional iterative tuning.

s[i++]="A Technique for Suppressing High-Frequency Vibrations in a Parallel Connection of Many Inverters^MonDIS-23.html^Xinrui Liu, Tian Xia, Shuang Li, Miao Yu and Feiyan Li  ^The widespread use of renewable energy sources like wind and photovoltaics has led to an increase in the penetration rate of inverters in the power grid in recent years. Nevertheless, the multi-inverter parallel system is prone to induce global high-frequency oscillations and harmonic amplification in a poor power grid environment. A number of factors contribute to this, including the inverters intricate relationship with the electrical grid and the peculiar harmonic coupling properties brought about by various line obstructions. Current research mainly focuses on local suppression methods, but there are still shortcomings in dealing with global multi-frequency oscillation. Consequently, this work presents a worldwide technique for suppressing high-frequency oscillations, using a mix of adaptive virtual impedance and PCC voltage feedforward active damping, aiming at suppressing harmonic interaction and resonance of multi-inverter parallel systems. The mathematical model of a parallel system with many inverters is first developed, and then the inverters harmonic interaction mechanism and its connection to line impedance are examined. Additionally, the possibility of high frequency resonance is greatly diminished through the utilization of adaptive virtual impedance technology, which dynamically modifies the inverters equivalent impedance, in conjunction with PCC voltage feedforward active damping, which improves the systems damping characteristics. Simulation and experimental validation demonstrate that the suggested technique may significantly decrease the total harmonic distortion rate (THD) of grid-connected current, while concurrently, it can significantly improve the parallel and series resonant problems of inverters, and offer a dependable solution for the consistent functioning of a multi-inverter grid-connected network in a poor grid environment.  <i>Keywords: </i>Multiple inverters parallel system, Weak power grid, Adaptive virtual impedance, Global high-frequency oscillations.  <sup>1</sup>College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. <sup>2</sup>State Grid Liaoning Electric Power Co., Ltd., Huludao Power Supply Company, Huludao, China."

The randomness of the wind determines the requirement for wind turbines to function at varying wind speeds, and these speeds affect the functional state of the turbines. Since the wind speed falls within the interval between the cut-in wind speed and the rated wind speed, the output power of the generator remains lower than the rated power. This article studies the problem of maximum energy capture of wind turbines under this situation. With a fixed pitch angle, to optimize the rotational speed of the wind turbine rotor as much as possible, we regulate the electromagnetic torque of the generator. The wind is characterized as a random process. Fully considering the randomness of the wind, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) is established based on the random interference it brings. By the solving of the SDE through the principle of dynamic programming, an analytical expression of the electromagnetic torque is derived. In the actual operation of wind farms, the electromagnetic torque can reach the target value by changing the generator current.  <i>Keywords: </i>Wind turbine, Stochastic optimal control, Dynamic programming principle, Maximum energy capture.

Therefore, a data-driven optimal control based on adaptive knowledge transfer (AKT-DDOC) for S O  of WWTP is proposed. First, a data-knowledge-driven evaluation strategy (DKDE) is designed to make full use of operation data and mechanism knowledge about S O  to construct the reasonable cost functions and constraints. Then, the cost functions and constraints are favorable to describe the relationships between performance indexes and S O . Second, a constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm with adaptive knowledge transfer (AKTCMO) is developed to handle the cost functions and constraints. Then, the optimal solutions of S O  satisfying the constraints can be obtained to effectively enhance the operation performance. Third, a proportional integral differential (PID) controller is introduced to attain accurate tracking of optimal set-points. Finally, the proposed AKT-DDOC is tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 to reveal its effectiveness. The simulation results indicate that AKT-DDOC can realize outstanding operational performance.  <i>Keywords: </i>Wastewater treatment process, Dissolved oxygen concentration, Data-knowledge-driven evaluation, Constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm, Adaptive knowledge transfer.

Consequently,CDOPs can be considered as expensive optimization problems (EOPs). To address these challenges, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are commonly employed, utilizing surrogate models to replace costly function evaluations. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Kriging surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to solve CDOPs. In Phase 1, when no feasible solution exists in the current sample set, a hybrid lower confidence bound criterion is introduced to guide the algorithm in quickly identifying a feasible solution. Once a feasible solution is identified, Phase 2 employs a lower confidence bound criterion based on information entropy to enhance the optimality of the solutions. Two industrial problems are used to test the algorithms effectiveness compared with other 3 surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms and PSO. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining optimality, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces computational costs.  <i>Keywords: </i>Constrained dynamic optimization problems, Kriging model, Infill sampling criterion, Lower confidence bound criterion.

However, traditional IRS methods relying on precise Channel State Information (CSI) and model-based optimization struggle to adapt to dynamic industrial environments. In this paper, we propose a model-free dynamic resource allocation method for IRS-assisted IWNs. First, a reliability expression based on equivalent channels is given by combining the phase shift of IRS and the allocated timeslots and powers. Then, we formulate the reliable transmission problem in IRS-assisted IWNs under multiple constraints (phase shift, time slots, and powers) as a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) problem. Finally, a double deep Q-Network is learned to solve the DRL problem.

However, their generalization ability in specialized domains, such as industry, remains limited due to a lack of domain-specific data. Defect detection plays a pivotal role in industrial workflow which ensures product quality, but traditional deep learning methods are constrained by model parameters and prior knowledge, limiting their performance. Some efforts have been made to fine-tune large vision-language models (LVLMs) using industrial datasets, but challenges like high training costs and the need for specialized data hinder progress. This paper proposes a novel method, Industrial Defect Detection-GPT (IDD-GPT), to effectively fine-tune LVLMs using small-scale industrial datasets. By constructing a cache model from few-shot industrial data, the method compares image features with the cache to improve defect detection accuracy. Additionally, multiple cache models are aggregated to enhance performance without exposing sensitive data. The results are converted into human-understandable text via prompt engineering.

While model-based and data-driven methods are widely used, they are constrained by model accuracy and the reliance on high-quality data, making it challenging to achieve reliable SOC estimation under complex and dynamic vehicle conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a fractional-order equivalent circuit model (FOM), with parameters identified offline using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), eliminating the need for frequent parameter calibration. The FOM is integrated with a hybrid SOC estimation approach combining the fractionalorder extended Kalman filter (FOEKF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Due to rapid fluctuations in current and voltage data under dynamic conditions, the estimated SOC curve exhibits significant variations, which can negatively impact network learning and estimation accuracy. To mitigate this issue, this study introduces the average current within a sliding window as an additional input, enhancing the models robustness to noise and improving its generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.8% and a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.6% on the test set with smoother SOC curves, confirming its high accuracy and reliability.  <i>Keywords: </i>lithium-ion batteries, State of charge, Fractional-order model, Long short-term memory, Additional input.

Although various longitudinal control strategies have been developed for CAVs to achieve string stability in mixedautonomy traffic systems, the potential impact of these controllers on safety has not yet been fully addressed. In this work, we propose safety-critical traffic control (STC), a strategy that allows a CAV to maintain safety relative to both the preceding vehicle and the following human-driven vehicles (HVs). Specifically, we utilize control barrier functions (CBFs) to impart collision-free behavior with formal safety guarantees to the closed-loop system. The safety of both the CAV and HVs is incorporated into the framework through a quadratic program-based controller that minimizes deviation from a nominal stabilizing traffic controller subject to CBF-based safety constraints. Considering that some state information of the following HVs may be unavailable to the CAV, we employ state observer-based CBFs for STC. We also design robust STC to guarantee traffic safety against actuator delay, measurement delay, and state delay.

s[i++]="Frequency Domain Matters: An Unsupervised Residual Information Injection Network for Pansharpening^SatA06-6.html^Yang liu, Wei Wang and Weihe Li  ^Pansharpening predicts high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by fusing high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images and multispectral low-resolution (LRMS) images. Spatial-domain pansharpening methods often generate HRMS images with insufficient high-frequency details. Some studies have endeavored to improve pansharpening performance in the frequency domain. Due to the lack of high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images for supervised training, current frequency domain methods often resort to downsampling full-resolution LRMS-PAN images while using full-resolution LRMS images as ground truth. This approach enables the network to be trained in a fully supervised manner at a reduced resolution. However, models trained on these downsized images tend to underperform when applied to full-resolution target images. This paper presents URIIN, an unsupervised residual information injection network, designed for pansharpening by applying appropriate loss function constraints to full-resolution PAN and LRMS images to generate HRMS images. We present the Frequency Injection Module (FIM), engineered to extract high-frequency residuals from PAN images in the frequency domain and inject them into MS images.

s[i++]="Robot Visual Localization via Improved Yolov8 based Segmentation of Depth Map^SatA06-9.html^Botao Di, Shuai Yuan and Haonan Xu  ^Localization is crucial for robot navigation, smart home systems, and augmented reality applications. Currently, most visual localization methods rely on identifying feature points within a scene. However, many of these methods use feature points that are not semantically meaningful, lack interpretability, and are not easily understandable. In contrast, the method proposed in this paper utilizes identifiable landmarks for localization, which are semantically meaningful and highly interpretable. Furthermore, in current localization methods, feature points may become unstable under changes in perspective, which adversely affects localization accuracy. The method proposed in this paper demonstrates strong robustness, as it uses landmarks that are comprehensible to humans, and thus, changes due to the cameras perspective do not affect the identification of these landmarks.<br />This paper novelly proposes a robot semantical visual localization method that combines an improved YOLOv8 segmentation approach with depth information. Initially, the improved YOLOv8 segmentation model is adopted to obtain the bounding box coordinates, labels, and segmentation masks of the interest region of the landmark. In the next place, these results are combined with the scene depth map predicted by depth estimation of the Lite-Mono monocular network. Then the depth information embedded in the depth map is extracted to calculate the distance from the robot to the landmarks. The robot position within the scene is estimated using plane geometric equations in coordinate form. In the object segmentation work, a dynamic up sampling module and a triplet attention mechanism are employed for improving segmentation performance and addressing the issue of varied light conditions, which are validated by contrasting with previous method. In the robot localization task, the depth estimation network is used for localization. The estimated trajectory error currently is preliminarily tested within 1 meter by comparing with the true trajectory, the experimental results generally illustrated the validity of the proposed algorithmwhich can be furtherly reduced with more accurate 3D sensor and improved model.

However, the detection task is exceptionally challenging due to small targets occupying fewer pixels in images and having inconspicuous features. This paper proposes a YOLOv8s-based method for small object detection that can effectively detect and locate small targets in remote sensing images(RSI). Firstly, We have designed a more effective multibranch flow component called C2f-MSCA, which includes the brand-new multi-scale convolutional attention (MSCA) module.

In contrast, recurrent-free methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have attracted significant attention because of their lightweight models and straightforward architectures. Traditional CNNs, however, are limited by their inherent weight-sharing property, which imposes a strong inductive bias and restricts their ability to capture spatial heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel trainable positional encoding convolutional neural network (TPE-CNN). TPE-CNN incorporates a positional encoding module to dynamically learn location-specific spatio-temporal correlations and temporal evolution patterns, addressing the inability of CNNs to handle absolute positional dependencies effectively. Additionally, we integrate large-kernel convolutions and inception modules, significantly enhancing global information awareness. This design enables the incorporation of global attention mechanisms while maintaining a low parameter count, achieving an optimal balance between performance and computational efficiency.

In recent years, the great development of remote sensing technology has greatly assisted the segmentation of urban green space and water body, both in terms of data quantity and quality. However, due to significant inter-class differences and huge training costs, the segmentation of urban green space and water body remains a challenging task. In the past two years, the introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) brought about innovation in the field of segmentation tasks. SAM exhibits good generalization and zero sample ability when processing various images and objects, and can segment any object in any image without the need for additional training. However, it is difficult to apply SAM to the field of remote sensing images. This is mainly because the complex situations such as occlusions and shadows in high-resolution remote sensing images, and retraining the large model requires significant computational and time costs. The proposal of Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques for large models provides a solution. PEFT techniques can quickly adjust model parameters to suit specific tasks with minimal data and computing resources. In this paper, a LoRA-based SAM model is proposed for urban green space and water segmentation tasks. High-resolution satellite remote sensing images within Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China are collected as samples for model fine-tuning training.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis framework integrating a dual-channel GoogLeNet architecture with transfer learning. First, vibration data is dual-processed into 2D feature maps using gram angular difference field for time-domain texture extraction and short-time Fourier transform for frequency-domain features. Then, a dual-channel input layer is designed to process these complementary features. By substituting auxiliary classifiers with residual learning modules, the architecture effectively stabilizes gradient propagation to counteract the destabilizing effects of network width expansion. Additionally, a parallel perception module is introduced to extract multi-scale features. By implementing a transfer learning framework that integrates pre-training on the NASA bearing dataset as foundational knowledge acquisition, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the model achieves effective domain adaptation while preserving learned feature manifolds.

In the dual-population algorithms, if the connection between the two populations is too tight, it is not conducive to the iteration of the population; On the contrary, the advantages of the dual-population mechanism cannot be fully developed. This paper proposes a dual-population constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a dynamic contact mechanism (DPDC) to address these limitations. The DPDC algorithm introduces a variable (ncse) to regulate the number of individuals from the auxiliary population in the offspring. Initially, the populations exhibit a strong degree of interaction. The auxiliary population promotes the movement of the main population toward the Pareto front, thereby enhancing the convergence of the main population. In later stages, the offspring includes fewer individuals from the auxiliary population. Consequently, the distribution of the main population gradually improves. This mechanism effectively balances convergence and diversity. To prove the algorithms effectiveness, it is tested on the benchmark test problem set DASCMOP, and the test results verify that the DPDC algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms five advanced constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.  <i>Keywords: </i>Constrained multi-objective optimization, Dual-population, Dynamic contact mechanism.

Existing research on storage layout optimization predominantly focuses on minimizing transportation distances but often neglects critical issues such as operational balance and yard congestion. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for yard layout, aiming to minimize the total transportation distance of export cargo to the terminal front and reduce the variance in yard operations. The model integrates considerations of transportation efficiency and the effective utilization of yard equipment. Given the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, the study employs a series of transformations, including relaxing integer variables, linearizing nonlinear constraints, and linearizing the objective function, to reformulate the problem into a convex optimization framework.

However, obtaining defect samples of workpiece such as cracks, pinholes, and folds, is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the samples collected often exhibit class imbalance, leading models to easily fall into local optima. Currently methods, such as under-sampling and over-sampling, all rely on a limited number of real samples and suffer from a lack of data diversity. To address these chanlledges, this paper proposes the aggregated data augmentation for defects using enhanced diffusion models and poisson blending. For defects such as cracks and pinholes, we propose a Segmentation Driven Generation method combining Segmenting Everything In Context(Seggpt) segmentation with Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation(GLIGEN) prompt generation to create defect samples for corresponding categories. For more complex defects such as folds, we introduce a module named PoissonSeg that integrates Seggpt segmentation with the Poisson equation to generate samples of complex defects.

It is large heavy equipment with high energy consumption. Therefore, modeling of its power is of significance for optimization of the operating. How-ever, due to the complex mechanism of the mill, the power is composite of several parts and difficult to be calculated accurately. This paper presents a hybrid power prediction model for SAG mills that integrates a mechanistic model with an XGBoost-based data-driven approach. Initially, the model applies physical equations to characterize the dynamic grinding process within the mill, capturing the systems essential physical behavior. In this formulation, the mill load power is decomposed into kinetic and frictional power, with kinetic power calculated and its proportion estimated to develop a comprehensive power equation. Subsequently, an XGBoost-based data-driven compensation model is introduced. This model incorporates three key internal state parameters predicted by the mechanistic model, enhancing insights into the mills internal conditions. The residual between the mechanistic models predicted power and the actual power is used as the target variable, to address the inherent limitations of the mechanistic model.

The connections between the items in the knowledge graph and their physical attributes are not well captured by the knowledge graph embedding models that are currently available. To improve the representation and embedding of the model, the input space should accurately reflect connection features in the knowledge graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-space mapping convolution embedding model for the knowledge graph completion, we dub it as ConvMultiview, which maps fact triples to Euclidean space and complex space respectively, and uses a convolutional layer composed of 1-D and 2-D convolution kernels to extract features to capture essential characteristics of fact triples. More specifically, first, the embedding vectors of knowledge graph triples are mapped to real sphere space and complex sphere space respectively. The mapping dimension of fact triples in these spaces is n&times;1. Subsequently, the fact triplets are joined to create an n&times;3 matrix. After that, the matrix is fed into a layer of convolution, which is made up of one-and two-dimensional layers, and it undergoes a number of filtering processes to produce various feature maps. Lastly, the matching score that is utilized to determine the fact triplet is the dot product. This research demonstrates that the multi-space mapping of knowledge graphs may fully describe the relationships in the knowledge base in addition to fully representing the hidden features in the original mapping.

s[i++]="A Unified Control Strategy for Arm-Quadruped Robots in Tasks Involving Dynamic Heights^SatA11-10.html^Haonan Wu, Xungao Zhong, Tao Gong, Zhijie Zou, Shaobo Kang and   ^Quadruped robots have made significant progress in robust control, however, the grasping tasks in complex environments still pose challenges for arm-quadruped. Specifically, when the targets are located at extreme heights (either too high or too low), the arm-quadruped robot often struggle to adjust their grasping postures, resulting in task failure. To address this issue, this study proposes a whole-body control strategy which tailored for object dynamic heights. The proposed strategy is designed based on reinforcement learning techniques to evaluate the performance of the end-effector relative to the target position. Additionally, a vision module is integrated into the end-effector, enabling the perception of the target pose and allowing precise adjustments to the overall grasping actions. Moreover, the dynamic range is extended to cover heights from 0m to 1.5m, enabling arm-quadruped robot to adaptively grasp objects located at extreme positions. Experimental results, benchmarked against baseline and traditional control methods, demonstrate a significant improvement in grasping success rates, validating the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach in complex environments.  <i>Keywords: </i>Arm-quadruped robots, Formatting, Reinforcement learning, Whole-body control.  <sup>1</sup>School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China. <sup>2</sup>School of Aerospace Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China."

Since native detection models such as YOLOv8 default their input images to have a high resolution, their backbone structure employs Strided Convolution, a method of reducing the resolution of the feature map and thus reducing computation and memory usage. This is a very efficient structure in other inspection tasks, but it is not suitable for PCB defect detection, which uses low-resolution images as input and has a small inspection target. To deal with this problem, the input image is first sharpened, which can effectively help the model to identify into as small defects. Subsequently, the SPD-Conv convolution is inserted into the backbone structure of YOLOv8 to ameliorate the effect of stepwise convolution. The specific idea of SPD-Conv is to rearrange the spatial dimension of the input image to the depth dimension so as to obtain more depth information without losing spatial information. The CA attention mechanism is then integrated into C2f, so that the network can give different weights to different channels of the image according to the information in the channel domain to obtain more important feature information. The SimAM attention mechanism is introduced to give higher attention to neurons in the inhibition state thus better extracting feature information of small target defects. And the WIoUv2 loss function is introduced to enhance the localization of PCB small target defects. The experimental results show that compared with YOLOv8s, the improved algorithm increases the average accuracy value by 4.9% on the PCB dataset, which effectively improves the leakage detection problem of YOLOv8s for small defects on the PCB surface.  <i>Keywords: </i>Small object detection, YOLOv8, Deep learning, Surface defect detection.

The leaching process, as the core step in lithium battery recycling, faces significant challenges in precise modeling and optimization due to its complex and variable environment, as well as the involvement of multivariate and nonlinear relationships. Traditional methods struggle to accurately model this process. In recent years, intelligent modeling and optimization technologies have provided new solutions to this problem. Although the BP neural network is widely used in modeling the leaching process, its limitations, such as susceptibility to local optima and slow convergence, hinder its performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes four improvements to the Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm and validates its superiority through the CEC2005 benchmark tests. Based on the improved HHO algorithm, a BPHHO neural network model is constructed and applied to optimize the lithium leaching process in lithium batteries. Experimental results demonstrate that the BPHHO neural network significantly outperforms the traditional BP neural network in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization performance. This not only simplifies the experimental process and reduces costs but also provides an efficient technical pathway for the resource utilization of spent lithium batteries, supporting the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry.  <i>Keywords: </i>Spent lithium batteries, Harris Hawk optimization algorithm, Lithium element, Leaching rate.

However, despite the demand for network flexibility and plug-and-play capabilities, existing research on distributed generation with fuel cells has been largely limited to the centralized framework. This paper develops a distributed hierarchical controller that enables networked hydrogen fuel cells to reach exact averaging of the sum of their load demand, even in the presence of varying topology and discontinuous communication. In the upper (cyber) layer, a novel distributed event-triggered average consensus observer is proposed. Different from existing dynamic averaging observers, the network topology is allowed to be switching and jointly connected, the load demand signal is allowed to be uncertain, and the event-triggering protocol can be designed locally. In the lower (physical) layer, a multi-physical control-oriented fuel cell model that integrates the electrical and physical dynamics is established, and an adaptive controller is designed to simultaneously guarantee asymptotic tracking and L &#8734;  tracking performance. Moreover, it is shown that with the proposed approach, load sharing performance can be sustained even when new agents join or leave the network permanently. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is validated on an experimental platform consisting of four networked hydrogen fuel cells. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first physical validation of multi-fuel cell generation with dynamic topology.  <i>Keywords: </i>Hydrogen fuel cells, Multi-agent systems, Resilient dynamic averaging, Hierarchical control.  <sup>1</sup>Department of Mechanical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. <sup>2</sup>School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering Beihang University, Beijing, China."

For the case where each agent holds an distributed local equality constraint, a distributed saddle-point algorithm is proposed by employing distributed filters to derive errors of the transmitted states for spatio-temporal compression purposes. It is shown that the resulting distributed compressed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Furthermore, the algorithm is generalized to the case where each agent holds a portion of the global equality constraint, i.e., the constraints across agents are coupled. By introducing an additional design freedom, the global equality constraint is shown to be equivalent to the one where each agent holds an equality constraint, for which the proposed distributed compressed saddle-point algorithm can be adapted to achieve linear convergence.

This study addresses the scenario where the actuators cooperate over a jointly connected switching communication network, which is time-varying and can be disconnected at any time instant.

The system model in question has two main characteristics. On the one hand, the system has significant inherent nonlinearity, allowing unknown parameters and time variables coupled to linear and high-order growth states. On the other hand, the system has unknown sensor sensitivities such that system states cannot be known accurately. These two features result in the problem being difficult to solve. By developing the time-varying gain technique and dynamic gain technique, we construct a novel output feedback control scheme, which not only guarantees the global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, but also avoids the singularity problem fundamentally. Moreover, different from the existing literature on fixed-time control, the designed control scheme is direct and simple, abandoning the traditional step-by-step design.

To address this, this paper proposes an improved apple leaf pest detection model based on YOLOv10. By introducing the CSP-Partial Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation (CSP-PMSFA) structure into YOLOv10n, the model utilizes Partial-Conv modules to efficiently extract multiscale features, thus enhancing the models representational power and ability to learn complex patterns. Additionally, the original PAFPN neck structure was replaced with an EMBSFPN that integrates ideas from BIFPN and MAF-YOLO, thus improving detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and reducing model parameters. Finally, a Lightweight Shared Convolutional Detector Head (LWSCD) was introduced, further reducing the number of model parameters and increasing detection efficiency. Experimental results show that the improved CEL-YOLO model increases precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP50 by 0.9%, 8.2%, 4.8%, and 6.2%, respectively, while also reducing the models parameter count and FLOPS by 37.8% and 33.8%.

Although the BeiDou satellite monitoring system has been widely used, monitoring data alone cannot ensure safety. To address this challenge, we propose a high and steep slope deformation prediction method (APEX-CPM) based on BeiDou highprecision monitoring data. Based on the partitioning of associated patches, this method integrates time resolution, time distance and channel dependency to perform composite feature modeling [1]. By partitioning associated patches of different sizes, we decompose the time series into associated patches of different time resolutions, and use multiple attention mechanisms to capture the local, global and channel correlations of the time series. In addition, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MOE) [2] model and Pathways [3], we use adaptive path exploration to further improve the generalization ability of the model under BeiDou high and steep slope monitoring data at different locations, so that it can dynamically adjust the composite feature modeling process according to the changes in the input time series, thereby ensuring the accuracy and generalization of APEX-CPM. Experiments conducted on a real dataset of high and steep slope deformation monitored by the Beidou satellite navigation system show that APEX-CPM is significantly better than the current advanced models in the field of long-term time series prediction in terms of prediction accuracy. Taking the BDS001 measurement point data as an example, the MSE of the model reached 0.82084 and the MAE was 0.70027.

However, since the capacity of a single HVAC unit is limited, aggregators are necessary to manage large-scale HVACs. Before participating in response tasks, aggregators typically need to collect data from individual HVAC units to determine their total response potential, which may infringe on user privacy. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach for evaluating the response potential of HVACs. By adopting a distributed communication protocol, HVACs only need to interact with their neighbors, reducing the privacy risk associated with centralized data collection. Simulations confirm that the proposed method is effective for large-scale HVAC systems while maintaining high accuracy in potential evaluation.  <i>Keywords: </i>Demand-side management, Potential evaluation, Distributed protocol, Heating, ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems (HVACs), Privacy-preserving.

In this paper, a Transformer-based model for household electricity consumption prediction is proposed and compared with the LSTM model, demonstrating the superior prediction accuracy and response capability of the Transformer. We first construct a dataset containing multi-dimensional features such as weather and time, and perform feature selection using Pearson correlation coefficient and Random Forest to screen out the factors that have significant impact on household electricity consumption. Then, this paper employs the Transformer model for electricity consumption prediction. In order to further optimize the households electricity expenditure, we introduce a time-of-use tariff mechanism, which integrates the scenario of electric vehicles supplying electricity to household loads through V2H (Vehicle-to-Home) technology. On this basis, an optimal scheduling strategy is developed with the objective of minimizing the electricity bill.

s[i++]="Power Curve Correction-based Data Augmentation for Wind Power Forecasting^SunA02-6.html^Siyang Meng, Ding Wang and Fang Yang  ^As an efficient new energy source, wind power promotes environmental protection and energy conservation. Accurate wind power prediction helps optimize energy scheduling, reduce operating costs, and improve grid stability. Current mainstream wind power prediction methods often utilize deep learning models based on weather forecasts. Deep learning methods always require large, high-quality datasets. Due to the geographical locations of wind farms and differences in weather forecast sources, weather predictions often turn out to be inaccurate or miss essential information, resulting in low data quality. This problem restricts the data fitting ability of deep learning methods. Even if data augmentation methods are used, there remains a significant difference between the enhanced dataset and the actual wind power data, which limits the improvement of prediction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes an augmentation method via power curve correction (PCC) for wind power data. It improves data quality by correcting the offset power generation curve to enhance inaccurate weather forecast data, and generates more accurate wind power data on the original data for expansion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method can provide high-quality data that conforms to the actual wind power data distribution.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based prediction method for aluminum production to address the challenges posed by dynamic data variation in aluminum electrolysis. By integrating reinforcement learning theory with ensemble learning techniques, the aluminum production prediction problem is framed as a Markov decision process, where the weights of baseline models are dynamically adjusted to optimize each models capacity to adapt to diverse operational conditions and data variations. This approach improves the prediction models accuracy and generalization capability for aluminum production. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is validated through real production data from aluminum electrolysis plants and public datasets.  <i>Keywords: </i>Reinforcement learning, Markov decision, Machine learning, Aluminum production.

However, the blast furnace ironmaking process (BFIP) involves multivariate sensor data (MSD) with complex interrelationships, posing substantial challenges to operational condition recognition. To address this issue, this study proposes a knowledge graph-guided time series registration (TSR) method for BF condition recognition.

Second, an optimization function integrating mutual information and maximal correlation coefficients is designed. Subsequently, a domain-specific knowledge graph for BFIP is constructed based on field investigations and expert knowledge, enabling calculation of initial time-delay intervals for each variable. Then, wavelet transform combined with dynamic time warping algorithm is employed to search for optimal time-delay sequences. Finally, operational condition recognition models are developed using real BF multi-sensor datasets before and after TSR. Comparative results demonstrate that the post-registration model achieves accuracy and precision improvements of 5.51% and 4.98% respectively compared to its pre-registration counterpart.

s[i++]="Learned Differential Flatness using Physics-informed Gaussian Process for Fixed-wing UAV Trajectory Tracking in Cluttered Environments^SunA08-6.html^Tianqing Liu, Yifeng Niu, Jie Li and Fei Zou  ^Trajectory tracking control is an important research topic for obstacle avoidance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and among the tracking strategies, those leveraging differential flatness show great promise. However, most differential flatness models rely on assumptions of simplified models and struggle with complex maneuvers, leading to significant tracking errors. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) to learn differential flatness models for trajectory tracking control. Two GPs are employed to learn the residuals of roll and pitch commands. A coordinate transformation module is designed to preprocess GP inputs for better generalization in different velocity directions. Semi-physical simulations demonstrate that our method improves the prediction accuracy of the commands and reduces tracking errors of position by 32.85% and the velocity by 12.92% compared with that using physical differential flatness when tracking trajectories with varying speeds in obstacle-dense environments.  <i>Keywords: </i>Differential flatness, Gaussian process, Trajectory tracking, Fixed-wing UAV.

However, some quality indicators cannot be directly measured and need to be indirectly measured using soft sensing techniques. Under complex operating conditions, the data exhibit characteristics of large volume and high dimensionality, which leads to low accuracy in soft sensing modeling. To address this issue, this paper proposes a soft sensing modeling approach that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Head Differential Attention (MHDA). Firstly, TCN is used to perform dilated causal convolutions on the input sequence to extract temporal features from the time-series data. Then, LSTM is employed to capture the long-term dependencies of the data. Finally, MHDA is used to assign different weights to the features, thereby retaining the necessary information from all inputs and reducing the interference of less important information on the prediction.

This paper proposes a robust control strategy for WPGSs with GSIs connected between variable speed PMSGs and grid-side based on continuous higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) theory. Firstly, the GSI model combining the current outer loop and voltage inner loop are built, which considers internal component parameter uncertainties. Next, three novel integral-type super-twisting sliding mode (STSMC) controllers are proposed to better control the time-varying powers exchanged between the GSI and the grid. Further, the predictable control gain and time-varying control gain in different STSMC are constructed to reduce control energy wastage and avoid over-calculation of uncertainty boundary after the system is disturbed. Finally, the multi-condition simulations considering parameter perturbations are designed to validate the proposed method.  <i>Keywords: </i>High-Order Sliding Mode Control (HOSMC), Gridside Inverters (GSIs), Wind Power Generation Systems (WPGSs), Parameter perturbation, Robust performance.  <sup>1</sup>School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China. <sup>2</sup>China Harbour Engineering Company LTD., Beijing, China."

The impact of the mixed problem of multi-type gas supply sources such as hydrogen generated by power-to-gas on integrated power-gas system was considered in [1]. Multiple distributed hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) in the distribution network were scheduled in [2] with a centralized management unit. Considering the risk of users privacy leakage and huge communication and computational burden on the centralized management unit, a distributed scheduling method was applied to an integrated hydrogen-electricity energy system in [3]. However, the power-to-hydrogen conversion was modeled as linear, which was too simplified to reflect the actual operating characteristics of the electrolyzers. Based on the above discussion, this paper proposes a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for networked hydrogen-based microgrids based on the eletrolyzers operating mechanism. Through problem transformation and Lagrangian duality, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch. Then a distributed consensus-based event-triggered dispatch algorithm with limited communication is further proposed.

Given the challenges of measuring inner wall temperatures, such as their stability and lag characteristics, this study employs the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX) model, and compares it with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, widely used in temperature forecasting, to explore their performance in predicting inner wall temperatures. A detailed comparison of these two models in terms of their effectiveness in predicting inner wall temperatures was conducted, along with an analysis of the impact of external meteorological parameters such as temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure on inner wall temperatures. The models were evaluated using actual measurements from a residential building environment in Xian. The results show that the SARIMAX model performs excellently in handling these exogenous variables, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.24% and an Index of Agreement (IA) of 0.98, demonstrating high prediction accuracy and reliability. In contrast, the LSTM model had a MAPE of 1.45% and an IA of 0.94. These results suggest that the SARIMAX model may be more effective in time series forecasting that includes a variety of meteorological impact factors. Regression analysis revealed that indoor temperature has the most significant impact on inner wall temperature, with a coefficient of 0.39, followed by external wall temperature, with a coefficient of 0.057. Since solar radiation and outdoor temperature primarily affect inner wall temperature through external wall temperature, their coefficients are relatively smaller, at 0.0003 and 0.0053, respectively. The historical values of inner wall temperature also have a strong impact, with coefficients of 0.25 and 0.38. These regression coefficients further illustrate that in the absence of outdoor meteorological data, external wall temperature can reflect some of the outdoor meteorological impact on inner wall temperature.  <i>Keywords: </i>SARIMA statistical model, LSTM neural network, Inner wall temperature prediction, Intelligent buildings, Time series analysis.

However, current MARL approaches often fail to adequately model interactions among multiple agents, particularly in intricate settings where algorithmic performance is jeopardized. In addition, the traditional MARL algorithm simply takes other agent status information as input for action selection, and does not further process these information, resulting in low information utilization efficiency.

Conventional 3D maps could not provide appropriate approaches to represent the multidimensional characteristics of the terrain. To enhance the autonomous navigation and exploration capabilities of intelligent mobile platforms in unstructured environments, a 3D mapping method based on lidar point cloud density analysis is proposed.

In mapping stage, the lidar point cloud data is preprocessed firstly. Then, the voxel grid point cloud density is calculated, and the spatial density representation is obtained by combining the density normalization coefficient. The step height feature is derived by calculating the height difference between adjacent voxel columns.

s[i++]="Occluded Person Re-identification Model Using Swin Transformer with Multi-Scale Features^SunBIS-24.html^Hongzhen Cai, Langwen Zhang and Wei Xie  ^Person re-identification is one of the important research directions in computer vision, but existing methods face issues such as low recognition accuracy in occluded scenarios. Recently, transformer-based models have been introduced to the person re-identification field, achieving promising results. However, in person re-identification, most transformer-based models currently only use the features from the last stage for recognition. These high-level features lack fine-grained information and are not effective in addressing the feature misalignment issue. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Features Fusion Swin Transformer (MSFF-Swin), which effectively integrates intermediate-layer and high-level features from the swin transformer. The inclusion of intermediate-layer features helps align the pedestrian features, addressing the feature misalignment caused by occlusion. Additionally, MSFF-Swin employs a multi-branch structure to downsample the intermediate-layer features, preserving the fine-grained information and effectively addressing the information loss brought by occlusion, thus improving the models robustness in occluded environments. Experimental results on both occlusion and general re-identification datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSFF-Swin network exhibits excellent performance and robustness to occlusion.  <i>Keywords: </i>Person re-identification, Occlusion, Swin transformer, Feature fusion.

s[i++]="A Contour-Feature based on Method of Point Segmentation for Sagger^SunBIS-25.html^Hao Deng, Jianqi An, Kang Yu and Jianru Xiong  ^In the industrial process of robotic sagger gripping, the accuracy of point cloud segmentation of sagger directly determines the accuracy of sagger positioning, which affects the final gripping result. However, the existing point cloud segmentation methods for sagger have insufficient segmentation accuracy and do not fully use the contour features of sagger. This paper presents a RANSAC point cloud segmentation method based on contour features of sagger. First, the method realizes the segmentation of the sagger contour by separating the sagger contour and searching the key points of the contour features. Then, the segmentation result of the sagger contour is divided into multiple regions, and the RANSAC algorithm is used to remove the curve point cloud in each region. Finally, the remaining sagger point cloud is mapped back to the 3D space, which improves the sagger localization accuracy. The experiments compare the performance of existing methods with the method in this paper from the perspective of time complexity and accuracy, and make full use of the contour features of sagger to prove that the method has the advantages of high segmentation accuracy, fast segmentation speed, and high robustness, which solves the problems of over-segmentation and under-segmentation in conventional point cloud segmentation.  <i>Keywords: </i>Process of robot gripping, Point cloud segmentation, Sagger contour features, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC).  <sup>1</sup>School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, 430074. <sup>2</sup>Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Intelligent, Automation for Complex Systems, Wuhan, China. <sup>3</sup>Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Technology for Geo-Exploration, Ministry of Education, Wuhan, China  /EADDRESS/</address><address><sup>4</sup>School of Future Technology, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China, 430074 /EADDRESS/ "

s[i++]="Adaptive Reactive Power Compensation Strategy Considering Active Power Curtailment of Wind Turbines^SunBIS-29.html^Zhilong Jin, Xia Zhou, Tengfei Zhang and Jianfeng Dai  ^The annual increase of wind power grid-connected capacity aggravates the instability of grid-connected point voltage. In order to achieve economic benefits, most wind turbines use maximum power tracking control to maximize active power output. When a large reactive power shortage occurs, the reactive power capacity that can participate in voltage regulation is difficult to meet the security and stability requirements. Therefore, taking Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator as an example, the power operation relationship is analyzed, and an adaptive reactive power compensation strategy considering the active power curtailment of wind turbines is proposed. During normal operation, the wind turbine works at the maximum power point. When the reactive load changes suddenly, the wind farm adopts adaptive control to participate in reactive power compensation on the basis of considering the ability of the unit to respond to reactive power regulation instructions. When the reactive power capacity is insufficient, the active load shedding control is carried out on part of the active power output of the wind turbine according to the priority, and the larger reactive power capacity is released to meet the reactive power demand of the system. Finally, a wind farm grid-connected system model is built on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified.  <i>Keywords: </i>PMSG, Adaptive reactive power control, Voltage disturbance, Active power curtailment.  <sup>1</sup>College of Automation &amp; College of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China. <sup>2</sup>Institute of Advanced Technology for Carbon Neutrality, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210023, China."

However, such a network struggles to resolve the inconsistencies that arise when dealing with multiple domains, as there are not only differences between the source and target domains but also among the various source domains themselves. Hence, this study introduces a novel approach called the dynamic transfer multi-source domain adaptation network (DTMDA), which features model parameters that adjust in response to the input data. The DTMDA is composed of two main parts: a feature extractor equipped with a dynamic transfer module (DTM) and a pair of classifiers incorporating an attention mechanism. The feature extractor, enhanced by the DTM, is capable of transforming multiple source domains into a single-source domain, facilitating the alignment of data distributions between source and target domains. This is achieved by aligning the target domain with any subset of the multi-source domains. Additionally, the classifiers are augmented with an attention mechanism to optimize the utilization of knowledge from multiple source domains for aligning data distributions.

s[i++]="DSF-DETR: An Optimized Detection Model for Small Package and Label Targets in Express Sorting^SunC01-5.html^Longfei Pan, Xinyue Zhou, Bize Zhang, Yongsheng Hou and Yuan Fan  ^In recent years, with the rapid development of e-commerce, the number of express packages has increased dramatically, placing immense pressure on sorting stations. Existing visual sorting algorithms can only detect packages themselves but fail to simultaneously detect labels on the packages. Moreover, their performance is suboptimal in scenarios with complex backgrounds, small targets, densely distributed objects, and severe occlusions, which are common in sorting stations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and efficient detection model, DSF-DETR, based on RT-DETR-R18. A novel DCNv4 Block module is introduced into the backbone network, enabling adaptive adjustment of convolution kernel sampling positions, thereby enhancing the extraction of information from densely distributed and heavily occluded packages. The Hybrid Encoder incorporates the SDFM (Superficial Detail Fusion Module), which performs fine-grained fusion of features at different scales, effectively capturing the detailed information of small target packages. Additionally, we employ Focaler-MPDIoU as the loss function to improve the models ability to detect packages and labels. Experimental results on the PAL-DET dataset demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model, DSFDETR achieves a 1.0% improvement in precision, a 1.2% increase in recall, and a 2.6% boost in mAP@0.5, with an FPS of 48.6, fully meeting the real-time and accuracy requirements of express sorting detection.  <i>Keywords: </i>Express package and label detection, RT-DETR, Loss function, Real-time detection, Small object detection.

Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure-from-motion (SfM) methods rely on complex camera calibration processes, limiting their adaptability in challenging environments. The DUST3R method leverages deep learning to generate dense point clouds without dependence on camera parameters; however, it lacks real-world scale information, restricting its application in measurement tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scale calibration method based on stereo cameras, using sparse point clouds from stereo vision to calibrate the scale of DUST3R point clouds. This approach combines the local precision of stereo vision with the global density of DUST3R, enabling truescale 3D reconstruction without external camera parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional accuracy and applicability of the proposed method. By averaging multiple measurements, the measurement error is significantly reduced, with a minimum error of only 0.18% and a maximum error of 2.32%. These results confirm the methods efficiency and reliability for 3D measurement tasks, offering a practical and effective solution.  <i>Keywords: </i>Stereo vision, DUSt3R, 3D measurement.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a crack detection method based on an improved Faster R-CNN. The method enhances detection performance through the following innovations: First, we replace the traditional feature extraction method with the ResLK Block and introduce a Large Kernel Attention (LKA) mechanism. This mechanism uses a 15x15 convolution kernel to enlarge the receptive field and capture global information, effectively solving the problem of multi-scale crack extraction. Secondly, to reduce information loss and retain more feature details, we replace the max pooling operation with the Merging model, which enhances the fusion of multi-dimensional information. Finally, we adopt a residual connection module to prevent the gradient vanishing problem, and directly add shallow low-level features to deep high-level features, thereby improving the networks ability to extract cracks. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements on the self-built dataset CrackDetect1990. Compared to the baseline model, the precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP) are improved by 15.82%, 16.92%, 18.4%, and 36.54%, respectively. These experimental results demonstrate that the crack detection method based on the improved Faster R-CNN can significantly enhance building crack detection, particularly for small-scale cracks.  <i>Keywords: </i>Faster R-CNN, Crack detection, Large kernel attention mechanism, Residual connection, Object detection.  <sup>1</sup>College of Information and Control Engineering, Xian University of Architecture and Technology, Xian 710055. <sup>2</sup>Key Laboratory of Building Robotics, Shaanxi Province, Xian 710055, China /EADDRESS/ "

However, most existing studies overlook the critical role of workers—often a scarce and essential resource-resulting in limited research on the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Constraints (FJSPWW). This paper presents an integer programming model that explicitly incorporates worker constraints into FJSPWW. To effectively solve this problem, an Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) is proposed.

These factors can lead to anomalies such as sensor failures or system malfunctions, making efficient anomaly detection critically important. However, anomalies in satellite telemetry data often appear as continuous segments, resulting in high requirement for the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. To address this issue, an anomaly detection framework based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM) is proposed in this paper. This framework utilizes the BiLSTM network for bidirectional prediction of telemetry data: forward prediction uses historical data to infer future trends, while reverse prediction leverages future information to review historical characteristics. By fusing the bidirectional information, the framework enhances the ability to detect anomalies and mitigates the impact of anomalous input. Additionally, this paper introduces a dynamic threshold method that adaptively sets the anomaly detection threshold based on the data characteristics, improving both detection accuracy and robustness.

Existing spatio-temporal behavior detection methods are primarily designed to analyze visible light or thermal infrared videos with clear and distinct human features. However, these methods are unsuitable for near-infrared videos that are widely used in monitoring field. Because near-infrared videos have a poor imaging quality and is subject to some interferences, leading to the bad application of tracking and analyzing the online near-infrared video in real-time. Therefore, it is of significant practical value to research methods for the human bodys spatio-temporal behavior detection in near-infrared surveillance videos. Based on a self-build dataset of near-infrared videos for behavior detection, the paper proposes a spatio-temporal behavior detection method for near-infrared surveillance videos using a combination of the YOLOv8n, DeepSort, and SlowFast models. This method aims to achieve multi-person behavior detection in the night scene. The experiments indicate that on the self-build near-infrared surveillance video dataset, the YOLOv8 algorithm model for pedestrian detection at night has a precision of 98.3%, a recall of 98.2%, and a mAP@0.50 of 99.20%.

Finally, the encoders from these two convolutional autoencoders are stacked together, followed by the addition of a classification layer to form the stacked convolutional autoencoder. This model is then utilized to classify the load state. PSO is employed to optimize both the filtering frequency band and the hyperparameters of the neural network.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Grouping and Aggregation Optimization Framework for Federated Learning with Incentive Mechanisms and Stability Assurance (GAO-FL), which promotes the active participation of more high-quality clients in federated learning tasks through a well-designed incentive mechanism. This framework integrates a reputation mechanism with reverse auction theory, comprehensively considering the data characteristics and hardware conditions of clients, enabling task initiators to select participants according to each participants reputation value and bidding strategy within budget and time constraints, thereby accelerating model training. Additionally, GAO-FL introduces a Dual Tolerance Exclusion Strategy (DTES) to identify and eliminate underperforming groups or clients, ensuring the stability of the framework. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAO-FL satisfies individual rationality, budget feasibility, and individual honesty and truthfulness. Experimental results show that under the GAO-FL framework, the average training time for federated learning tasks is reduced by 28% to 69% compared to existing classical schemes, significantly improving the efficiency of federated learning.  <i>Keywords: </i>Reverse auction, Federated learning, Incentive mechanism, Reputation mechanism.

Due to its high sensitivity, it has been widely applied in detecting defects in complex transmission lines. However, the velocity effect induced by dynamic detection can lead to signal distortion, thereby affecting the detection performance and accuracy. This study investigates the impact of velocity on detection signals and aims to achieve dynamic localization of defects in transmission lines. By observing alarge-small-large  regular fluctuation trend in the signals, the defect location range is determined. Subsequently, the reverse spike phenomenon can be utilized for precise defect localization. The study further reveals that when the sensor moves too fast, the detection depth of the signal is significantly reduced, making it unable to detect defects in the inner aluminum strands and steel core layers. Conversely, when the sensor moves too slowly, the accuracy of defect location detection decreases significantly.

However, acquiring fault samples in industrial environments is both time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose an unsupervised learning approach called ViT-AnoWGAN (Vision Transformer Autoencoder Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network), specifically designed to detect bearing anomalies using only normal data samples for training. The method begins by transforming industrial data into time-frequency representations (TFRs) using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). These TFRs are then input into the ViT-AnoWGAN model. The architecture integrates a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder, which maps time-frequency representations (TFRs) into a latent space. A pre-trained Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) generator is used as the decoder to reconstruct the TFRs from this latent space.

However, the delineation task of dangerous organs is extremely complicated, which requires doctors to spend a lot of time and energy, and is easy to lead to human error, resulting in adverse effects. CT images of endangered organs have the independence of biological tissue. Because of the particularity of the pelvic region, the contrast between organs is low and the edges of organs are not clear, so it is difficult to segment the organs at risk accurately.

The global encoder is used to learn the global feature representation, which is able to capture the overall context information of the image and help understand the global structure and shape in the image.

Against the backdrop of environmental challenges and technological advances, PDE emerges as a key strategy for increasing agricultural productivity. However, there is a need to scrutinize farmers financing options due to the associated costs and uncertainty in supply and demand. This paper examines the equilibrium strategies of farmers and platforms under different financing models with and without PDE, and analyzes the impact of PDE on the choice of financing model and the profitability of both parties. We find that the farmer does not always benefit from PDE, while the platform always does. In the face of demand uncertainty, the platform and the farmer share the same preference for bank financing, whether with PDE or not. Fluctuations in demand have a negative impact on the platforms profit, as well as on the farmers profit without PDE, but has a positive impact on the farmer profit with PDE.  <i>Keywords: </i>Supply chain management, Platform digital empowerment, Platform financing, Demand uncertainty, Supply uncertainty.

Collaborative coverage path planning is one of the critical issues in the field. Based on the advantages of Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition (BCD), which is more lightweight and efficient in storage and computation and has a more regular traversal path, BCD has a wide range of applications. Currently, there are some issues with BCDrelated algorithms at both the path planning and task allocation levels. For a structured indoor environment, the original unit segmentation method did not consider side-by-side obstacles, which may result in losing some areas under special circumstances, making it impossible to traverse the entire environment. On the other hand, task allocation only considers the area threshold, leading to fragmented task allocation, which may reduce overall execution efficiency. This article proposes an improvement of BCD based on region area threshold and vertex degree to avoid the problems of fragmented allocation of unit clusters occurring in special situations with pure threshold criteria and ensuring the unique connectivity determined within the unit cluster through breadth-first search.

s[i++]="A Hypergraph Neural Network-Based Model with Temporal Dependency Fusion and Dynamic Node Embedding for fMRI Data Classification^SunD10-1.html^Xinyue Yan, Yiyu Feng, Ruifeng Zhang and Xianfu Zhang  ^Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides valuable information about spontaneous activities and interactions between different brain regions. However, traditional functional connectivity networks (FCNs) usually rely on static, single-view connectivity patterns and cannot effectively reflect the dynamic changes and complex multi-layer structures of brain activities. To address this limitation, a temporal dynamic hypergraph neural network (TD-HGNN) model is proposed to capture temporal information and high-order interactions in brain neural networks. The TD-HGNN model represents each fMRI sample as a node in a hypergraph and extracts features from multiple perspectives for classification. The framework includes an attention-based temporal feature fusion module and a hypergraph generation module, which can effectively capture the complex interactions and temporal dependencies between different brain regions. By leveraging the structural properties of hypergraph neural networks, TD-HGNN integrates spatial, temporal, and activity features, providing a detailed description of the dynamic brain network changes associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). Experimental results on an AD dataset show that TD-HGNN achieves significant accuracy and stability in identifying AD pathology.  <i>Keywords: </i>Functional MRI, Hypergraph, Disease identification.

s[i++]="OC-DETR: DETR with Orthogonal Channel Attention and CSPO-Fusion for component detection of TEDS^SunD10-2.html^Chaowei Song, Gang Peng, Chaoze Wang, Mingjun Cong, Cong Li and Xinbin Xiong  ^In recent years, the evolution of automated maintenance technology for high-speed railways has positioned the Train of EMU failures Detection System (TEDS) as a critical technology for ensuring the safe operation of high-speed trains. TEDS employs line-scan cameras along railway tracks to capture undercarriage and side-view images of Electric Multiple Units (EMUs). However, the diverse shapes of EMU components, complex component backgrounds, and a large number of small components have intensified the challenges of designing component detection algorithms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel real-time component detection framework known as OC-DETR (DETR with Orthogonal Channel Attention and CSPO-Fusion). The framework incorporates a specialized feature fusion module named CSPO-Fusion, within the Cross-Scale Feature Fusion Module (CCFM) to adeptly handle the small target features of EMU components. Additionally, the framework integrates the orthogonal channel attention into the block of the backbone, effectively reducing the redundant information caused by traditional convolution and improving the accuracy of component detection. To further enhance performance across diverse scales, we propose an IoU-aware size-dependent weighted loss function which increases detection precision for small, medium, and large components. In this paper, the TEDS installed at the throat of the train is used to collect the data of EMUs, and the TEDS dataset including CRH380 and CR400AF is constructed. Extensive experimental validation using this dataset demonstrates that the accuracy and speed of the proposed method have improved compared with the current mainstream target detector, and the detection mAP50 of this method is increased by 2.2% compared with the RT-DETR benchmark target detection algorithm, which effectively verifies the effectiveness of this algorithm.  <i>Keywords: </i>TEDS, Orthogonal channel attention, CSPO-fusion, Component detection, Lightweight network.  <sup>1</sup>Huazhong University of Science and Technology School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation Wuhan, China. <sup>2</sup>Wuhan Lisai Technology Co., Wuhan, China. <sup>3</sup>Beijing Railway Engineering Electromechanical Technology, Research Institute Co., Beijing, China."
s[i++]="Structure Modelling and Evolution Trend Analysis of the Silk Trade Network Along the Belt and Road Countries^SunD10-3.html^Huang Jiayang, Tang Qiang, Liu Jie, Mu Tiange, Niu Haoying, Wang Yuting and Zhou Hui  ^Based on the silk trade data between countries along the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR or BRI) from 2001 to 2022, An undirected and weighted network of silk trade year by year during the past two decades are constructed in this paper. We explore the topological structure and evolutionary trend characteristics of these silk trade networks between countries along the OBOR initiative from the perspective of network analysis. The topology of silk trade networks between countries and their evolution trend characteristics are calculated and compared. Based on empirical threshold method commonly used in the literature (selecting the trade relations with import trade value over 100,000 US dollars as the threshold, filtering and simplifying to get the backbone network), the study explains the dynamic changes of the corresponding backbone network in the time dimension and the roles of the different key nodes through the analysis of the year-by-year evolution of the degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and other network characteristics of the relevant trade network. Our results show that: (1) The OBOR initiative has an increasingly significant impact on the silk trade of 65 countries along OBOR, and the initiative proposed by China has significantly advanced the depth and breadth of silk trade cooperation between countries. China, India, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Thailand have become increasingly important players in silk trade along the BRI. (2) Through the analysis on the evolution of 16 kinds of higher-order node relationships in the silk trade network between countries along the OBOR more than 20 years, it is found that, the OBOR Initiative has a significant impact on the transmission of silk trade, which is the key to the success of OBOR Initiative. The Initiative has significantly promoted the number of higher-order node relationships mainly characterized by transmission, triangular input and triangular output. However, for the input and triangular output node relationships, the numbers of higher-order node relationships have been significantly reduced. However, for the input and output types of higher-order node relationships, the change in their number does not show a significant trend. The results of this paper show that continuing to promote the construction of the OBOR initiative helps to enhance Chinas discourse power in silk trade, optimize the structure of the trade network, and strengthen the resilience of the trade network of this product. In addition, through the implementation of the OBOR Initiative, it can strengthen Chinas relationship with international market, and strengthen the relationship between China and international market. It also can strengthen the cooperation and dialog between China and international market. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the establishment of such trade relations in the risk early warning mechanism, to further improve Chinas silk trade security risk management.  <i>Keywords: </i>One belt and one road, Silk trade, Social network analysis, Higher-order ties.  <sup>1</sup>Research Center of Nonlinear Science Wuhan Textile University Wuhan, P.

Nevertheless, in practical applications, researchers commonly suffer from the scarcity of spectral samples because collecting enough spectral samples is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The intuitive idea is to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to the target domain, but this may lead to a certain degree of data leakage. Additionally, directly integrating multi-source domain information may overlook the differences in spectral data distribution across different domains. To remedy these issues, we propose an end-to-end training scheme titled Federated Learning based Multi-source Domain Generalization (FLMDG) to explore multi-source domain integration while considering data privacy protection. In particular, to avoid data leakage, we design a federated learning framework specifically for spectral data, sharing only the backbone of the network. Moreover, we propose a domain classifier on the serverside of federated learning to weaken the impact of domain differences on transfer performance in an adversarial training manner. Extensive experiments on several publicly available spectral datasets show that the proposed FLMDG significantly outperforms existing methods.  <i>Keywords: </i>Deep learning, Transfer learning, Domain generalization, Federated learning, Spectral identification.

s[i++]="A Multi-Stages UAVs Cooperative Task Allocation Method based on Improved SMA^SunD11-4.html^Mingyuan Yang and Wei Wang  ^The task allocation of UAVs is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. Compared to solving the traditional problem, existing algorithms face greater difficulty in obtaining high-quality solutions for multi-UAV collaborative confrontation task allocation across multiple stages. The increased complexity arises from the additional factors of multi-stage and multi-UAV collaboration, which expand the solution space, increase the number of variables, and impose more constraints, making the optimization problem more intricate. As a result, existing exact algorithms require significant computation time, while heuristic algorithms tend to fall into local optima, leading to poor population diversity and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an improvement to the Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA). First, we introduce a population initialization strategy to enhance the quality of the initial population. Second, in the stage where the slime mold surrounds the food, we implement a dominant individual supplement strategy to mitigate the local optima issue caused by the randomness inherent in individual generation in SMA. Next, to improve population diversity and maintain its quality, we design a duplicate solution elimination strategy to remove redundant solutions within the population. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) in terms of convergence efficiency, particularly as the sclae of UAVs increases.  <i>Keywords: </i>Task allocation, Multi-stage, Multi-UAVs cooperation, Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA).

However, the underactuated, strongly coupled, and nonlinear characteristics of QUAV, along with external disturbances, pose significant challenges in developing an accurate path-following controller. To address the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a tube-based model predictive control (MPC) method for QUAV. A cascade control strategy is developed, which divides the QUAV system into four subsystems: the rotational subsystem, the x-direction subsystem, the y-direction subsystem, and the z-direction subsystem. Then, the state deviation models for the x, y and z-direction subsystems are developed. Considering the external disturbances encountered by the QUAV during flight, tube-based MPC controllers are designed for the x, y and z-direction subsystems to mitigate these disturbances. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed tubebased MPC method. The results demonstrate that, compared to traditional MPC, the proposed tube-based MPC effectively mitigates disturbances and significantly enhances the robustness of the system.  <i>Keywords: </i>Tube-based model predictive control, Guadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle, Trajectory tracking control.

In the training phase of image super-resolution, the more feature information the input image contains, the better the training model can learn the mapping relationship, and the finer the texture and edge information of the reconstructed high-resolution image will be. However, for most anchor-based neighborhood regression methods, the feature information extracted from the image patches by the gradient operator alone are insufficient. Our proposed method adopts a doublelayer anchored neighborhood regression strategy. In the first layer, the initial high-resolution (HR) image is generated by adjusted ANR (A+) method, which serves as the input to the next layer. In the second layer, we apply the muti-feature based anchored neighborhood regression. Through the multi-feature extraction method, the texture and edge information data are significantly expanded, thereby effectively enhancing the detail representation in the reconstructed HR image. Furthermore, we improve the local constraint in the LANR method. To address the situation where the high-resolution image patches corresponding to similar low-resolution image patches in the neighborhood are dissimilar, a similarity weight adjustment matrix is introduced to weaken the influence of dissimilar highresolution image patches in the reconstruction process.

Traditional methods rely on numerical models based on aerodynamics. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in PM2.5 prediction. Previous deep learning methods mainly used observational data from monitoring stations. This paper proposes a deep learning PM2.5 prediction model that integrates numerical model forecast data, called PM-PCNet. The model consists of three parts: periodic feature extraction, trend feature extraction, and covariate relationship extraction. First, the input time series is decomposed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The decomposed wavelet coefficients are then fed into the wavelet feature extraction module. By utilizing a discrete wavelet attention module, the model captures both local and global dependencies within the time series. These features are subsequently reconstructed back into the time domain during the reconstruction stage, completing the extraction of periodic features. Trend feature extraction is accomplished through multiple layers of decomposition modules. A Transformer encoder module is used to compute attention mechanisms in the feature dimension. This effectively learns the relationships between covariates. The model is validated using PM2.5 prediction data from Changsha in 2022 and 2023.

s[i++]="Container Drayage Transportation Optimization Considering Multi-size and Multi-visit^SunDIS-37.html^Chao Huang, Xiaoyang Zhou, Boyang Qu, Xin Yuan and Li Yan  ^This study explores a container drayage operation using a fleet of homogeneous trucks to transport heterogeneous containers in a local area. Each truck has the same capacity for carrying containers. Containers of different sizes are transported by trucks among different locations, and several customers need to be visited several times to satisfy specific requirements of these customers, thus virtual nodes corresponding to these customers are generated. An improved state transition method is introduced to describe the states of trucks, and a mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model is constructed. The optimization objective is to minimize the total fuel consumption cost of all used trucks. The nonlinear model is linearized through introducing several auxiliary variables. A number of experiments are carried out based on randomly generated instances to analyze the performance of the mathematical model. Experimental results demonstrate that optimal solutions can be obtained for small- and medium-scale instances. Additionally, the impact of replacing certain 20-foot containers with 40-foot containers in requests is explored.  <i>Keywords: </i>Drayage transportation, Multi-size and multi-visit, Nonlinear mathematical model, Improved state transition method, Linearization method.  <sup>1</sup>School of Automation and Electrical Engineering Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China. <sup>2</sup>School of Cyberspace Security Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, China."

This study primarily focuses on the collaborative multi-depot scenario in the “last-mile” electric vehicle delivery, investigating the multidepot EV routing problem while considering factors such as customer satisfaction service time windows, charging stations (CSs), and heterogeneous EVs (MDHEVRPTW). Subsequently, a mixed integer non-linear programming model is formulated with the objective of minimizing total costs while imposing constraints on node access, EV capacity, and battery levels. Furthermore, a linear reconstruction method is proposed to find optimal solutions for smaller-scale problems. To address large-scale issues and the NP-hard characteristics, an improved adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (I-ALNS) is designed, incorporating a novel destroy operator specifically for CS. Experimental results on instances of varying sizes indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of solution speed and quality.

However, most existing DRCB path planning strategies adopt heuristic algorithms and often fall short in terms of solution accuracy and computational efficiency, making them inadequate for practical application. Therefore, this paper proposes a path planning strategy that combines Dijkstras algorithm with Q-learning. First, Dijkstras algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path between any two nodes in the transportation network. Then, based on the results, the Q-learning algorithm is employed to explore the shortest path passing through multiple target nodes. Finally, experimental validation is conducted. The results demonstrate that Dijkstras algorithm can enhance the speed and accuracy of the Q-learning algorithm in solving DRCB path planning problem.  <i>Keywords: </i>Demand response, Customized bus, Path planning, Q-Learning algorithm, Dijkstras algorithm.  <sup>1</sup>School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China. <sup>2</sup>Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. <sup>3</sup>School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."

However, GWO still has the problems of slow convergence and weak global optimization ability similar to other swarm intelligence algorithms. In this paper, a Multi-Strategy Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (MSIGWO) algorithm is proposed to improve the convergence speed and planning ability. The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows:First, a multi-objective evaluation function including path length cost, path depth cost and path energy consumption cost is constructed to judge the performance of algorithms. Second, the compound chaotic sequence is introduced into the standard GWO to improve the population initialization effect. The roulette mechanism is introduced. Among the three strategies of new individual global optimization, elite individual local optimization and balance optimization, the grey wolf position update strategy is randomly selected, which effectively improves the balance between global optimization and local optimization. Third, MSIGWO is compared with GWO and PSO on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

To achieve this, three major challenges must be overcome: insufficient human-robot interaction, ambiguity of human language in the open world, and cost-effective deployment. In this paper, we propose an efficient grasping method that allows non-expert users to effortlessly obtain the desired object transferred by a robot solely through intuitive human-robot dialogue. Our approach is centered around an Large Language Model(LLM)-based decision-making module and integrates voice interaction, visual perception, and grasping control module. The vision module perceives the objects class and pose, and then the decision-making module aligns the visual and linguistic data to conduct causal and spatial reasoning. Our approach is cost-effective and easy to implement, requiring only prompt engineering and visual network post-processing.

The traditional continuous-time parameterizaiton adopts the cumulative B-splines, causing the complexity in implementation and abstraction of control points. To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous-time visual-inertial odometry (VIO) based on generalized Hermite spline. The analytical temporal derivatives and Jacobians with respect to the control points are derived, so that the VIO is further formulated as a sliding window based optimization. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, the extensive evaluations are conducted on the TUM VI and EuRoC dataset.

s[i++]="Grid-Connection Control Strategy for Synchronous Wind Generator Based on Physical Model Experimental System^MonDIS-41.xml^Zhe Li, Aimin Zhang, Lei Wan and Xuming Gao  ^This paper investigates the key challenges in the field testing of traditional wind power grid-connection systems. A Physical Model Experimental System (PMES) based on a synchronous wind generator is proposed to simulate the behavior of wind turbines. The system employs a hybrid topology integrating uncontrolled rectification and controlled inversion, which is characterized by its simple structure and strong replicability. To address the DC bus voltage fluctuations caused by AC input variations under the uncontrolled rectification grid-connection mode, an enhanced grid-voltage-oriented vector control strategy combined with fuzzy PID-based inverter grid-connection control is developed. This method ensures the stability of the DC bus voltage and precise regulation of the power factor on the AC side. Simulink simulations show that the proposed grid-connection control strategy significantly improves dynamic response, enhances the accuracy of DC voltage regulation, reduces AC-side current harmonics, and provides high-quality grid-connected power.  <i>Keywords: </i>Synchronous wind power experimental system, Uncontrolled rectification, Grid-Connection control, Fuzzy PID control.

Traditional methods often struggle to effectively capture the complexities inherent in molecular structures, making the prediction task both significant and difficult. In response, we propose an intelligent sensing and modeling approach utilizing Transformer architectures. By leveraging the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a sequential molecular representation, we develop a Transformer-based autoregressive model capable of generating novel molecular compounds, predicting molecular properties, and optimizing chemical structures. Our model incorporates advanced techniques such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), rotary positional encodings, and grouped query attention (GQA), enabling it to capture hierarchical dependencies accurately and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our Transformer-based method compared to traditional RNN-based models, especially in handling data sparsity and computational complexity. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations on validation and test datasets confirm the model's ability to generate chemically valid, structurally diverse molecules, highlighting its transformative impact on drug discovery and molecular informatics.  <i>Keywords: </i>Transformer models, SMILES, Molecular prediction, Drug design, Machine learning.
